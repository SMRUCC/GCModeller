''' <summary>
''' Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (also functional enrichment analysis) is a method 
''' to identify classes of genes or proteins that are over-represented in a large set of 
''' genes or proteins, and may have an association with disease phenotypes. The method 
''' uses statistical approaches to identify significantly enriched or depleted groups of 
''' genes. Microarray and proteomics results often identify thousands of genes which are 
''' used for the analysis.
