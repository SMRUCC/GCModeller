        '''   total number Of clusters exceeds Kmax.
        ''' + In a random order, merge the two clusters which leads 
        '''   to the maximum increase in the marginal likelihood. 
        '''   This operator considers also merging of singleton clusters
        '''   (only one pregroup in the cluster) that might be generated 
        '''   by the other operators.
        ''' + In a random order, split each cluster into two subclusters 
        '''   using complete linkage clustering algorithm, where the 
        '''   distance between two pregroups are calculated As the average 
        '''   linear correlation coefficient between vectors In the two 
        '''   pregroups. Then Try reassigning Each subcluster To another 
        '''   cluster including empty clusters. Choose the split And 
        '''   reassignment that leads To the maximal increase In the 
        '''   marginal likelihood(5).

        '''   nPregroup Is the total number Of pregroups In the cluster.
