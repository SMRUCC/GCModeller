    ''' The align.seqs command aligns a user-supplied fasta-formatted candidate sequence file to a

    ''' to make a pairwise alignment between the candidate and de-gapped template sequences using the 
    ''' Needleman-Wunsch, Gotoh, or blastn algorithms; and iii) to re-insert gaps to the candidate and 
    ''' template pairwise alignments using the NAST algorithm so that the candidate sequence alignment 
    ''' is compatible with the original template alignment. We provide several alignment databases 
    ''' for 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences that are compatible with the greengenes or SILVA alignments; 
    ''' however, custom alignments for any DNA sequence can be used as a template and users are encouraged

    ''' quality as good as the SINA aligner. Furthermore, this rate can be accelerated using multiple

    ''' <param name="fasta$"></param>
    ''' <param name="calc$">
    ''' mothur has several ways of calculating a distance based on how gaps are treated. First, the 
    ''' default option - onegap - only counts a string of gaps as a single gap. For example:
    ''' 
    ''' ```
    ''' SequenceA  ATGCATGCATGC
    ''' SequenceB  ACGC---CATCC
    ''' ```
    ''' 
    ''' Would have two mismatches And one gap. The length Of the shorter sequence Is 10 nt, since the 
    ''' gap Is considered As a Single position. Therefore the distance would be 3/10 Or 0.30. This Is 
    ''' the distance calculating method employed by Sogin et al. (1995). The logic behind this type Of 
    ''' penalty Is that a gap represents an insertion And it Is likely that a gap Of any length represents 
    ''' a Single insertion. This can be called within mothur by the command:
    '''
    ''' ```
    ''' mothur > dist.seqs(fasta=amazon.unique.filter.fasta, calc=onegap)
    ''' ```
    ''' 
    ''' DNADIST actually ignores gaps. For example the two sequences above would have a distance Of 2/9 Or 
    ''' 0.2222. This type Of distance calculation does Not make much sense For sequences that are known To 
    ''' have a significant number Of insertions. This can be used In mothur Using the nogaps Option. mothur 
    ''' can use this distance calculating method With the command:
    '''
    ''' ```
    ''' mothur > dist.seqs(fasta=amazon.unique.filter.fasta, calc=nogaps)
    ''' ```
    ''' 
    ''' A final Option Is To penalize Each gap. For the two sequences above, the distance would be 5/12 Or 
    ''' 0.4167. This can be used In mothur Using the eachgap Option. mothur can use this distance calculating 
    ''' method With the command:
    '''
    ''' ```
    ''' mothur > dist.seqs(fasta=amazon.unique.filter.fasta, calc=eachgap)
    ''' ```
    ''' </param>
    ''' <param name="countends$">
    ''' There is some discussion over whether to penalize gaps that occur at the end of sequences. 
    ''' For example, consider the following sequences:
    ''' 
    ''' ```
    ''' Sequence1 ATGCATGCATGC
    ''' Sequence2 ---CAAGTA---
    ''' ```
    ''' 
    ''' If terminal gaps are penalized, As Is the Default (And we are Using the calc=onegap Option), 
    ''' Then the distance would be 4/8 Or 0.5000. If they are Not penalized, Then the distance would 
    ''' be 2/6 Or 0.3333. Ideally, all sequences would be aligned over the same region; however, If 
    ''' this Is Not possible Or desired For some reason the ends Option can be employed To tell mothur 
    ''' To ignore the penalization:
    '''
    ''' ```
    ''' mothur > dist.seqs(fasta= amazon.unique.filter.fasta, countends=F)
    ''' ```
    ''' 
    ''' The Default Is For countends To equal T.

    ''' <param name="cutoff#">
    ''' If you know that you are not going to form OTUs with distances larger than 0.10, you can tell 
    ''' mothur to not save any distances larger than 0.10. This will significantly cut down on the
