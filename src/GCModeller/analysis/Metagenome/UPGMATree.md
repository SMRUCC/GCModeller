# UPGMA

**UPGMA** (**U**nweighted **P**air **G**roup **M**ethod with **A**rithmetic Mean) is a simple agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering method. The method is generally attributed to Sokal and Michener.

The UPGMA method is similar to its weighted variant, the WPGMA method.

Note that the unweighted term indicates that all distances contribute equally to each average that is computed and does not refer to the math by which it is achieved. Thus the simple averaging in WPGMA produces a weighted result and the proportional averaging in UPGMA produces an unweighted result.
