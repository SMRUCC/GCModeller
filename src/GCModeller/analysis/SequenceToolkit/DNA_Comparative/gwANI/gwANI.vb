    ''' ### pANIto
    ''' Given a multi-FASTA alignment, output the genome wide average nucleotide identity (gwANI) 
    ''' For Each sample against all other samples. A matrix containing the percentages Is outputted. 
    ''' This software loads the whole file into memory.
    '''
    ''' #### Usage
    ''' ```
    ''' $ panito
    ''' Usage: panito [-hV] &lt;file>
    ''' This program calculates the genome wide ANI for a multiFASTA alignment.
    '''   -h          this help message
    '''   -V          print version and exit
    '''   &lt;file>   input alignment file which can optionally be gzipped
    ''' ```
    '''
    ''' #### Input format
    ''' The input file must be a multi-FASTA file, where all sequences are the same length:
    '''
    ''' ```
    ''' >sample1
    ''' AAAAAAAAAA
    ''' >sample2
    ''' AAAAAAAAAC
    ''' >sample3
    ''' AAAAAAAACC
    ''' ```
    '''
    ''' #### Output
    ''' ```
    '''         sample1	    sample2	    sample3
    ''' sample1	100.000000	90.00000	80.000000
    ''' sample2	-			100.000000	90.000000
    ''' sample3	-			-			100.000000
    ''' ```
    '''
    ''' #### Etymology
    ''' pANIto has 'ani' in the middle. In Spanish it means babylon.
