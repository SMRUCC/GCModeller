''' ### pANIto
''' Given a multi-FASTA alignment, output the genome wide average nucleotide identity (gwANI) 
''' For Each sample against all other samples. A matrix containing the percentages Is outputted. 
''' This software loads the whole file into memory.
'''
''' #### Usage
''' ```
''' $ panito
''' Usage: panito [-hV] &lt;file>
''' This program calculates the genome wide ANI for a multiFASTA alignment.
'''   -h          this help message
'''   -V          print version and exit
'''   &lt;file>   input alignment file which can optionally be gzipped
''' ```
'''
''' #### Input format
''' The input file must be a multi-FASTA file, where all sequences are the same length:
'''
''' ```
''' >sample1
''' AAAAAAAAAA
''' >sample2
''' AAAAAAAAAC
''' >sample3
''' AAAAAAAACC
''' ```
'''
''' #### Output
''' ```
'''         sample1	    sample2	    sample3
''' sample1	100.000000	90.00000	80.000000
''' sample2	-			100.000000	90.000000
''' sample3	-			-			100.000000
''' ```
'''
''' #### Etymology
''' pANIto has 'ani' in the middle. In Spanish it means babylon.
