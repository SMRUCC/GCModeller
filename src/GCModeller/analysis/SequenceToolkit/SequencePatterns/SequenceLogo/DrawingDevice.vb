<p>A systematic computational analysis of protein sequences containing known nuclear domains led to the identification of 28 novel domain families. 
                        This represents a 26% increase in the starting set of 107 known nuclear domain families used for the analysis. Most of the novel domains are present in all major eukaryotic lineages, but 3 are species specific. For about 500 of the 1200 proteins that contain these new domains, nuclear localization could be inferred, and for 700, additional features could be predicted. 
                        For example, we identified a new domain, likely to have a role downstream of the unfolded protein response; a nematode-specific signalling domain; and a widespread domain, likely to be a noncatalytic homolog of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.</li>")>

          Abstract:="A graphical method is presented for displaying the patterns in a set of aligned sequences. 
The characters representing the sequence are stacked on top of each other for each position in the aligned sequences. 
The height of each letter is made proportional to Its frequency, and the letters are sorted so the most common one is on top. 
The height of the entire stack is then adjusted to signify the information content of the sequences at that position. 
From these 'sequence logos', one can determine not only the consensus sequence but also the relative frequency of bases and the information content (measured In bits) at every position in a site or sequence. 
The logo displays both significant residues and subtle sequence patterns.",
