    ''' <summary>
    ''' Model name; &lt;s> is a single word containing no spaces or tabs. The name is normally picked up
    ''' from the #=GF ID line from a Stockholm alignment file. If this Is Not present, the name Is created
    ''' from the name Of the alignment file by removing any file type suffix. For example, an otherwise
    ''' nameless HMM built from the alignment file rrm.slx would be named rrm. Mandatory.

    Public Property MAXL As Integer
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Symbol alphabet type. For biosequence analysis models, &lt;s> is amino, DNA, or RNA (case insensitive).
    ''' There are also other accepted alphabets For purposes beyond biosequence analysis,
    ''' including coins, dice, and custom. This determines the symbol alphabet And the size Of the symbol
    ''' emission probability distributions. If amino, the alphabet size K Is Set To 20 And the symbol
    ''' alphabet to “ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY” (alphabetic order); if DNA, the alphabet size K Is set
    ''' to 4 And the symbol alphabet to “ACGT”; if RNA, the alphabet size K Is set to 4 And the symbol

    ''' character field For Each match state In the main model (see below) Is valid; If no, these characters
    ''' are ignored. Indicates that the profile model was created such that emission probabilities at masked
    ''' positions are Set To match the background frequency, rather than being Set based On observed
    ''' frequencies in the alignment. Position-specific insertion And deletion rates are Not altered, even in
    ''' masked regions. Optional; assumed To be no If Not present.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <returns></returns>
    Public Property MM As String
    ''' <summary>

    ''' residue field For Each match state In the main model (see below) Is valid. If no, these characters
    ''' are ignored. Consensus residue annotation Is determined When models are built. For models Of
    ''' Single sequences, the consensus Is the same As the query sequence. For models Of multiple alignments,
    ''' the consensus Is the maximum likelihood residue at Each position. Upper Case indicates
    ''' that the model's emission probability for the consensus residue is an arbitrary threshold (0.5 for
    ''' protein models, 0.9 for DNA/RNA models).

    ''' these characters are ignored. Consensus Structure annotation Is picked up from a Stockholm file's
    ''' #=GC SS_cons line, And propagated to alignment displays. Optional; assumed to be no if Not
    ''' present.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <returns></returns>
    Public Property CS As String
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Map annotation flag; &lt;s> is either no or yes (case insensitive). If set to yes, the map annotation
    ''' field in the main model (see below) Is valid; if no, that field will be ignored. The HMM/alignment map
    ''' annotates each match state with the index of the alignment column from which it came. It can be
    ''' used for quickly mapping any subsequent HMM alignment back to the original multiple alignment,
    ''' via the model. Optional; assumed To be no If Not present.
