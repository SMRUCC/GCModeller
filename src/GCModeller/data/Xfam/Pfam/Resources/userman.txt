  This document currently includes a more detailed description of the
  fields used in the Pfam database.  The format of Pfam entries has
  become stricter and we now enforce some ordering of the fields.
  Pfam entries are composed of four sections shown in the figure
  below.

  Header Section:
  ---------------

  The header section mainly contains compulsory fields.  These include
  Pfam specific information such as accession numbers and identifiers,
  as well as a short description of the family.  The only
  non-compulsory field in the header section is the PI field.  All the
  fields in this section are described below.

  AC   Accession number:          PFxxxxx or PBxxxxxx

       The Pfam-A accession numbers PFxxxxx are the stable identifier
       for each Pfam families.  The Pfam-B accession PBxxxxxx numbers
       are not stable between releases of Pfam.

       PFxxxxx for Pfam entries
       PBxxxxxx for Pfam-B entries

  ID   Identification:            15 characters or less

       This field is designed to be a meaningful identifier for the
       family.

       Capitalisation of the first letter will be
       preferred. Underscores are used in place of space, and hyphens
       are only used to mean hyphens.

  DE   Definition:                80 characters or less

       This must be a one line description of the Pfam family.

  AU   Author:

       Author of the entry.

       The format for this record is shown below, this is a comma
       separated list on a single line.

       AU   Bloggs JJ, Bloggs JE

  BM   HMM building command lines.  

       See the HMMER3 user's manual for full instructions on building
       HMMs. Also see URL:

       http://hmmer.janelia.org

       An example of the BM lines from a single entry

       BM   hmmbuild  -o /dev/null HMM SEED
 
  SM   HMM searching command line

       See the HMMER3 user's manual for full instructions on building
       HMMs. Also see URL:

       http://hmmer.janelia.org
     
       An example of the SM line for a family:

       SM   hmmsearch -Z 9421015 -E 1000 HMM pfamseq

  SE   Source of seed:    

       The source suggesting seed members belong to a family.

  GA   Gathering threshold:   

       Search threshold to build the full alignment.

       GA lines are the thresholds in bits used in the hmmsearch
       command line.  An example GA line is shown below:

       GA   25.00 15.00;

       The order of the thresholds is sequence, domain

       The corresponding hmmsearch command line for the HMM
       would be:

       hmmsearch -T 25 --domT 15 HMM DB

       The -T option specifies the whole sequence score in bits, and
       the --domT option specifies the per-domain threshold in bits.

  NC   Noise cutoff:

       This field refers to the bit scores of the highest scoring
       match not in the full alignment.

       An example NC line is shown below

       NC   19.50 18.10;

       As with the GA line, this field contains two numbers - the
       first number in the set refers to the highest whole sequence
       score in bits of a match not in the full alignment, and the
       second number specifies the highest per-domain score in bits of
       a match not in the full alignment.  These two scores may not
       refer to the same sequence.

  TC   Trusted cutoff:

       This field refers to the bit scores of the lowest scoring match
       in the full alignment.

       An example TC line is shown below

       TC   23.00 16.10;

       As with the GA line, this field contains two numbers - the
       first set refers to the lowest whole sequence score in bits of
       a match in the full alignment, and the second number specifies
       the lowest per-domain score in bits of a match in the full
       alignment.  These two scores may not refer to the same
       sequence.

  TP   Type field:                 Single word

       The type field is a compulsory field describing the type of
       family.  At present it can be one of:

       TP   Family
       TP   Domain
       TP   Repeat
       TP   Motif

  PI   Previous IDs:               Semi-colon list

      The most recent names are stored on the left.  This field is
      non-compulsory.


  Reference Section:
  ------------------

  The reference section mainly contains cross-links to other
  databases, and literature references.  All the fields in this
  section are described below.


  WK   Wikipedia Reference:        A special database reference for wikipedia.

       This is the name of the wikipedia article.  All of the articles
       we cite are from the English version of wikipedia.  Therefore
       the name needs to be appended to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.
       For example:

       KW   Piwi;

       Thus, the corresponding page in wikipedia would be
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piwi.

  DC   Database Comment:           Comment for database reference.

  DR   Database Reference:         Reference to external database.

       All DR lines end in a semicolon.  Pfam carries links to a
       variety of databases, this information is found in DR lines.
       The format is

       DR   Database; Primary-id;

       For SCOP links a third field is added indicating the level of
       placement in the SCOP hierarchy. Examples of each database link
       are shown below.

       For PDB links the second field contains the PDB identifier and
       chain identifier if present. The third and fourth fields contain
       the start and end points within the PDB entry.

       Examples:

  Comment Section:
  ----------------

  The comment section contains functional information about the Pfam
  family.  The only field in the comment section is the CC field.

  CC   Comment:
 
       Comment lines provide annotation and other information.
       Annotation in CC lines does not have a strict format.

       Links to Pfam families can be provided with the following
       syntax:

       Pfam:PFxxxxx.

       Links to SWISS-PROT and SP-TrEMBL sequences can be provided
       with the following syntax: 

       Swiss:Accession.

       Links to the enzyme classification database (EC) can be provided
       with the following syntax:

       EC:X.X.X.X 


  Alignment Section:
  ------------------

  NE   Pfam accession;         Pfam family <accession> may be nested within this
                               family.  Family <accession> aand this family are
                               allowed to overlap.

  NL   Sequence/start-stop;    Indicates the location of the nested domain
                               within the full alignment.  Tied to a sequence

  SQ   Sequence:               Number of sequences, start of alignment.

  //                           End of alignment





  The alignment is in Stockholm format.  This includes mark-ups of four
  types:

     #=GF <featurename> <Generic per-File annotation, free text>
     #=GC <featurename> <Generic per-Column annotation, exactly 1 char per column>
     #=GS <seqname> <featurename> <Generic per-Sequence annotation, free text>
     #=GR <seqname> <featurename> <Generic per-Sequence AND per-Column mark up, exactly 1 char per column>

  Recommended placements:

     #=GF Above the alignment
     #=GC Below the alignment
     #=GS Above the alignment or just below the corresponding sequence
     #=GR Just below the corresponding sequence

  The alignment formats have the following size limits:

     <aligned sequence>: max 4096 characters.
     <seqname>: max 50 characters.
     <featurename> max 50 characters.

  These details can also be found on the web, see URL:

     http://sonnhammer.sbc.su.se/Stockholm.html

  Structural mark ups are provided by Pfam.  For each sequence of
  known structure we provide #=GR lines with feuturenames SS
  for secondary structure. For the whole family we provide
  consensus #=GC lines with feature names SS_cons.

  Pfam marks up active site residues in the multiple sequence
  alignments.  Active site residues are derived from the Swiss-Prot
  feature table.  Active sites which are not annotated in the Swiss-Prot
  feature table as being probable, potential or by similarity are
  given the feature name AS.  

  Pfam predicts a residue to be an active site residue if it aligns
  in a Pfam alignment with a Swiss-Prot annotated active site, and is of
  the same amino acid type.  Active sites which are predicted by Pfam
  are given the feature name pAS.

  Active site residues which are annotated in Swiss-Prot as being
  probable, potential or by similarity are marked as predicted active
  sites, as long as they do no overlap with a Pfam predicted active site.
  Active sites which are annotated as probable, potential or by
  similarity by Swiss-Prot are given the feature name sAS.

  In all cases, active sites are marked with an asterix.  Below is an example: 


     #=GR SERA_ECOLI/12-325 AS      ...........*..............
     #=GR SERA_ECO57/12-325 pAS     ...........*..............
     #=GR YN14_YEAST/124-327 sAS    ........*.................


  The consensus sequence for both the SEED and full alignment are provided by
  Pfam, denoted by #=GC seq_cons at the beginning of the line.  In all cases 
  a threshold of 60% is used (i.e 60% or above, of the amino acids in this
  column belong to this class of residue). Below is the key to the alignment 
  mark up.  The program used was orginally from the Consensus program by Nigel
  Brown of the EMBL.

  Flat-files:
  -----------

  Historically, the Pfam library of HMMs has been searched against the
  UniProtKB database.  As of release 22.0, we have started providing
  Pfam domain annotations for sequences from metagenomics projects and
  sequences from the NCBI NR database.  The flat-files called
  Pfam-A.full and Pfam-A.seed are based on the UniProtKB database.
  Additional files for the NCBI NR and metagenomics sequences are
  outlined below.

  We also provide two tab-delimited files, Pfam-A.regions.tsv and
  Pfam-A.clans.tsv, containing a summary of all Pfam-A regions and a 
  summary of all Pfam clans respectively.  These failes are detailed
  below.


  NCBI GenPept sequences

  We download a fasta file of the non-redundant (NR) protein sequences 
  from the NCBI ftp site and can be found on the Pfam ftp site.  All
  NR protein sequences which score above the curated threshold for each
  Pfam-A family are included the in the full alignment for that family.
  The alignments for the NR data can be found in the file
  'Pfam-A.full.ncbi'.

  For release 23.0, for this dataset we resolved overlaps between clan
  members.  For release 24.0 we have not done this and we do not plan
  to for future releases.  This means there will inevitably be some
  overlapping hits between families that belong to the same clan.

  There may also be some overlaps between Pfam-A families that are not
  in the same clan.  However, since we curate Pfam-A domain thresholds
  in a conservative manner to ensure high specificity (at the expense
  of some sensitivity), we expect the number these overlaps to be low.

  The file 'genpeptpfam' is depricated.

  Metagenomics

  The file 'metaseq' contains a fasta file of metagenomics sequences
  that we have collected from various sources.  All metagenomics
  sequences which score above the curated threshold for each Pfam-A
  family are included the in the full alignment for that family.  The
  alignments for the metagenomics data can be found in the file
  'Pfam-A.full.metagenomics'.  

  As with the NR protein data, we have not resolved any overlaps, which
  means that there will inevitably be some overlapping hits between
  families that belong to the same clan, and there may be a low number
  of overlaps between families that do not belong to the same clan.

  The file 'metagenomicspfam' is deprecated.

  Pfam-A.regions.tsv

  This file contains a list of all Pfam-A regions. The columns are:
  sequence accession, sequence version, CRC64, MD5 checksum, Pfam-A
  accession, start residue for the match, end residue for the match.

  Pfam-A.clans.tsv

  This file contains a list of all Pfam-A families that are in clans.
  The columns are: Pfam-A accession, clan accession, clan ID, Pfam-A
  ID, Pfam-A description.


  Redundant Versions of Pfam-A families
  -------------------------------------

  Representative Proteomes (RPs), are proteomes that are selected from 
  Representative Proteome Groups (RPGs) containing similar proteomes 
  calculated based on co-membership in UniRef50 clusters. Representative 
  Proteome is the proteome that can best represent all the proteomes in 
  its group in terms of the majority of the sequence space and information. 

  RPs at 75%, 55%, 35% and 15% co-membership threshold are provided to 
  allow users to decrease or increase the granularity of the sequence space 
  based on their requirements (Chen et al., 2011).

  As of release 27.0, full alignments are provided on each set (where sequences
  are present), providing increasing redundant versions of each family
  alignment.

  Pfam-A.full.rp75 - Pfam-A matches against RP75, 75% co-membership threshold. 
  Pfam-A.full.rp55 - Pfam-A matches against RP55, 55% co-membership threshold.
  Pfam-A.full.rp55 - Pfam-A matches against RP35, 35% co-membership threshold.
  Pfam-A.full.rp15 - Pfam-A matches against RP15, 15% co-membership threshold,
                     the most redundant set..

  Active site alignments

  As of release 22.0 we have added an option in the program
  pfam_scan.pl to predict active sites.  


  Deprecated stockholm tags:

  AM   buildmethod             This tag was previously used to denote
                               the order in which matches from the two
                               HMMER2 models (global and fragment)) were aligned 
                               to give the full alignment.
