# OBO Graphs : Developer-friendly graph-oriented ontology JSON/YAML

> Original library for java: https://github.com/geneontology/obographs

This repo contains both a specification for a ``JSON/YAML`` format for ontology exchange, plus a reference VisualBasic object model and OWL converter.

The core is a simple graph model allowing the expression of ontology relationships like `forelimb SubClassOf limb`:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "UBERON:0002102",
      "lbl": "forelimb"
    },
    {
      "id": "UBERON:0002101",
      "lbl": "limb"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "subj": "UBERON:0002102",
      "pred": "is_a",
      "obj": "UBERON:0002101"
    }
  ]
}
```

Additional optional fields allow increased expressivity, without adding complexity to the core.

## Motivation

Currently if a developer needs to add ontologies into a software framework or tool, there are two options for formats: obo-format and OWL (technically obo is an OWL syntax, but for pragmatic purposes we can separate these two).

This presents a number of problems: obo is simple, but employs its own syntax, resulting in a proliferation of ad-hoc parsers that are generally incomplete. It is also less expressive than OWL (but expressive enough for the majority of bioinformatics tasks). OWL is a W3 standard, but can be difficult to work with. Typically OWL is layered on RDF, but RDF level libraries can be too low-level to work with (additionally: rdflib for Python is very slow). For JVM languages, the OWLAPI can be used, but this can be abstruse for many routine tasks, leading to variety of simplifying facades each with their own assumptions (e.g. BRAIN).

## Overview

OBO Graphs (OGs) are a graph-oriented way of representing ontologies or portions of ontologies in a developer-friendly JSON (or YAML). A typical consumer may be a Python developer using ontologies to enhance an analysis tool, database search/infrastructure etc.

The model can be understood as two levels: A __basic__ level, that is intended to satisfy 99% of bioinformatics use cases, and is essentially a cytoscape-like nodes and edges model. On top of this is an __expressive__ level that allows the representation of more esoteric OWL axioms.

## Basic OBO Graphs (BOGs)

The core model is a property-labeled graph, comparable to the data model underlying graph databases such as Neo4j. The format is the same as [BBOP-Graphs](https://github.com/berkeleybop/bbop-js/wiki/Graph).

The basic form is:

```json
"graphs": [
  {
     "nodes" : [...],
     "edges" : [...],
  },
  ...
]
```

Here is an example of a subgraph of Uberon consisting of two nodes and one part-of edge:

```json
{
  "nodes" : [
    {
      "id" : "UBERON:0002470",
      "lbl" : "autopod region"
    }, {
      "id" : "UBERON:0002102",
      "lbl" : "forelimb"
    }, {
      "id" : "UBERON:0002101",
      "lbl" : "limb"
    }, {
      "id" : "UBERON:0002398",
      "lbl" : "manus"
    }
  ],
  "edges" : [
    {
      "subj" : "UBERON:0002102",
      "pred" : "is_a",
      "obj" : "UBERON:0002101"
    }, {
      "subj" : "UBERON:0002398",
      "pred" : "part_of",
      "obj" : "UBERON:0002102"
    }, {
      "subj" : "UBERON:0002398",
      "pred" : "is_a",
      "obj" : "UBERON:0002470"
    }, {
      "subj" : "UBERON:0002470",
      "pred" : "part_of",
      "obj" : "UBERON:0002101"
    }
   ]
}
```

The short forms in the above (e.g. `UBERON:0002470` and `part_of`) are mapped to unambiguous PURLs using a JSON-LD context (see below).

Edges can also be decorated with `Meta` objects (corresponding to reification in RDF/OWL, or edge properties in graph databases).

Formally, the set of edges correspond to OWL SubClassOf axioms of two forms:

 1. `C SubClassOf D` (aka `is_a` in obo-format)
 2. `C SubClassOf P some D`(aka `relationship` in obo-format)

For a full description, see the JSON Schema below

Nodes collect all OWL annotations about an entity.

Typically nodes will be OWL classes, but they can also be OWL individuals, or OWL properties (in which case edges can also correspond to SubPropertyOf axioms)

## Expressive OBO Graphs (ExOGs)

These provide ways of expressing logical axioms not covered in the subset above.

Currently the spec does not provide a complete translation of all OWL axioms. This will be driven by comments on the spec.

Currently two axiom patterns are defined:

 * equivalenceSet
 * logicalDefinitionAxiom

Note that these do not necessarily correspond 1:1 to OWL axiom types. The two above are different forms of equivalent classes axiom, the former suited to cases where we have multiple ontologies with overlapping

See [README-owlmapping.md](README-owlmapping.md) for mor details

## Comparison with BBOP-Graphs

See [bbop-graph](https://github.com/berkeleybop/bbop-graph)

 * Top-level object in a bbop-graph is a `graph` object; in obographs a `GraphDocument` is a holder for multiple graphs
 * `meta` objects are underspecified in bbop-graphs

## Comparison with SciGraph

See [Neo4jMapping](https://github.com/SciGraph/SciGraph/wiki/Neo4jMapping)

The mapping is similar, particularly with respect to how SubClassOf axioms map to edges. However, for SciGraph, more advanced axioms such as EquivalenceAxioms are mapped to graph edges. In obographs, anything outside the BOG pattern is mapped to a custom object.

Note also that SciGraph returns bbop-graph objects by default from graph query operations.

## Running the converter

```bash
mvn install
./bin/ogger src/test/resources/basic.obo
```

Note that the conversion [will be rolled into tools like ROBOT](https://github.com/geneontology/obographs/issues/5) obviating the need for this. We can also make it such that the JSON is available from a standard PURL, e.g.

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo.obo
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo.json NEW

## Including obographs in your code:

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.geneontology</groupId>
    <artifactId>obographs</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```groovy
compile 'org.geneontology:obographs:${project.version}'
```

### Installing a development snapshot

When developing against an unreleased snapshot version of the API, you can use Maven to install it in your local m2 repository:

```
mvn -Dgpg.skip install
```

## Javascript
