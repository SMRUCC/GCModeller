    ''' ##### GO as a Graph
    ''' 
    ''' The Structure of GO can be described In terms Of a graph, where Each GO term Is a node, And the relationships between the terms are 
    ''' edges between the nodes. GO Is loosely hierarchical, With 'child' terms being more specialized than their 'parent' terms, but unlike 
    ''' a strict hierarchy, a term may have more than one parent term (note that the parent/child model does not hold true for all types of 
    ''' relation)
    ''' 
    ''' (功能定义,term相当于一个节点，节点之间的继承关系是非严格的，即某一个子节点可能会有多个父节点)
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' #### Sample GO Term
    ''' The following Is a GO term taken from the OBO format file.
    ''' 
    ''' ```
    ''' id: GO : 0016049
    ''' name: cell growth
    ''' Namespace:  biological_process
    ''' def: "The process in which a cell irreversibly increases in size over time by accretion and biosynthetic production of matter similar to that already present." [GOC:ai]
    ''' subset: goslim_generic
    ''' subset: goslim_plant
    ''' subset: gosubset_prok
    ''' synonym: "cell expansion" RELATED []
    ''' synonym: "cellular growth" EXACT []
    ''' synonym: "growth of cell" EXACT []
    ''' is_a: GO:0009987 ! cellular process
    ''' is_a: GO:0040007 ! growth
    ''' relationship: part_of GO : 0008361 ! regulation of cell size
    ''' ```
    ''' </remarks>
    Public Class Term : Inherits base

        ''' <summary>
        ''' A textual description of what the term represents, plus reference(s) to the source of the information. 
        ''' All new terms added to the ontology must have a definition; there remains a very small set of terms 
        ''' from the original ontology that lack definitions, but the vast majority of terms are defined.

        <Field("def")> Public Property def As String
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Alternative words or phrases closely related in meaning to the term name, with indication of the relationship between the name 
        ''' and synonym given by the synonym scope. The scopes for GO synonyms are:
        ''' + exact
        '''   an exact equivalent; interchangeable With the term name
        '''   e.g. ornithine cycle Is an exact synonym of urea cycle
        ''' + broad
        '''   the synonym Is broader than the term name
        '''   e.g. cell division Is a broad synonym of cytokinesis
        ''' + narrow
        '''   the synonym Is narrower Or more precise than the term name
        '''   e.g. pyrimidine-dimer repair by photolyase Is a narrow synonym of photoreactive repair
        ''' + related
        '''   the terms are related In some way Not covered above
        '''   e.g. cytochrome bc1 complex Is a related synonym of ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase activity virulence Is a related synonym of pathogenesis
        ''' 
        ''' Custom synonym types are also used In the ontology. For example, a number Of synonyms are designated As systematic synonyms; 
        ''' synonyms Of this type are exact synonyms Of the term name.

        ''' the molecular function term retinal isomerase activity is cross-referenced with the Enzyme Commission 
        ''' entry EC:5.2.1.3; the biological process term sulfate assimilation has the cross-reference MetaCyc:PWY-781.
