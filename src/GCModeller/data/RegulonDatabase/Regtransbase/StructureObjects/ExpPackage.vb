    'Regtransbase structure (1st level)

    'Introduction

    'RegTransBase is a database containing information about regulatory sequences and interactions as well as descriptions of experiments concerning those sequences and interactions.

    'Here we describe the structure of the 1st level of RegTransBase which consists of annotations of literary sources (journal articles). We also propose the creation of the 2nd level of RegTransBase by our experts, which will contain curated data concerning individual regulatory interactions. 

    'Annotation of each article in RegTransBase contains a set of regulatory elements (i. e. “players” in experiments described in the article), links between those elements and information about each experiment (including a list of elements participating in the experiment).

    'Document flow in the 1st level of RegTransBase:
    '- Annotator takes the package of articles (as hard copies) in the office. Also, curator sends him a file containing a “blank annotation” by e-mail. “Blank annotation” contains the title, authors list, abstract and some other information for each article in the package. Curator composes “Blank annotation” file using the curator program.
    '- Annotator imports the “blank annotation” into the RegTransBase annotation program in his computer. Using the annotation program, he enters information about experiments and regulatory elements for all of the articles in the package. When the work is done, the annotator exports the file with annotation and sends it back to the curator (hard copies of the articles also should be returned).
    '- Curator imports the annotation into the database and checks it using the curator program. If annotations are true and accurate, he accepts it (in other cases, he returns package to the annotator for improvement).

    Public Class Relations_of_regulatory_elements

        'Possibility to establish relations between regulatory elements is an important feature of RegTransBase. “Child” element in relation of two elements designated as subelement. All regulatory element except Regulator, Effector and Helix can have subelements. Different types of regulatory elements have different sets of possible subelements (see table 1). 

        'Any subelement can have several “parents”. For instance, regulatory site controlling expression of two different genes can be a subelement of those genes.
