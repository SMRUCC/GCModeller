    ''' 2. Article (ExpArticle)    
    ''' A separate set of regulatory elements and experiments is created for each article in the package (see below). When work with article is completed, annotator sets the article in one of the following states: Completed, Unrelated or Unclear. “Completed” state means the article contains important information which was entered into database (i.e. annotation includes at least one experiment). Annotator sets “Unrelated” state if there were no important experiments in the article. “Unclear” state used if the annotator can not make a decision about the article..
