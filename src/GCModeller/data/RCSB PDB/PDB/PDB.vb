''' <summary>
''' The **RCSB PDB file format** is a standardized text-based format used to represent 3D structural
''' data of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses. Managed by the
''' Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), it serves as the primary format for 
''' entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a global repository for experimentally determined structures. 
''' Below is a detailed introduction:
''' 
''' ---
''' 
''' ### **Key Features**
''' 
''' 1. **Text-Based Structure**:  
'''    Plain text file (`.pdb` extension) with a **fixed-column format**, meaning data is organized 
'''    into specific columns for consistency. Each line begins with a **record type** (e.g., `ATOM`, 
'''    `HETATM`, `HEADER`) that defines the data it contains.
''' 
''' 2. **Core Components**:  
'''    - **Atomic Coordinates**: Stored in `ATOM` (standard residues) and `HETATM` (heteroatoms, e.g., water, ligands) records.  
'''    - **Metadata**: Includes details like the title (`TITLE`), experimental method (`EXPDTA`), authors (`AUTHOR`), and biological source (`SOURCE`).  
'''    - **Sequence Information**: Provided in `SEQRES` lines.  
'''    - **Secondary Structure**: Annotated in `HELIX`, `SHEET`, and `TURN` records.  
'''    - **Connectivity**: Bonds between atoms are listed in `CONECT` lines.  
'''    - **Crystallographic Data**: Unit cell parameters (`CRYST1`), symmetry operations, and resolution.
''' 
''' 3. **Example ATOM/HETATM Line**:  
'''    ```
'''    ATOM   2301  CA  SER A 301      26.417  24.105  34.560  1.00 30.97           C  
'''    HETATM 9101  O   HOH A 910      10.500  20.100  30.500  1.00 25.00           O  
'''    ```
'''    - **Columns 1-6**: Record type (e.g., `ATOM`).  
'''    - **Columns 7-11**: Atom serial number.  
'''    - **Columns 13-16**: Atom name (e.g., `CA` for alpha carbon).  
'''    - **Columns 17-20**: Residue name (e.g., `SER` for serine).  
'''    - **Column 22**: Chain identifier (e.g., `A`).  
'''    - **Columns 23-26**: Residue number.  
'''    - **Columns 31-54**: X, Y, Z coordinates.  
'''    - **Columns 55-60**: Occupancy and temperature factor (B-factor).  
'''    - **Columns 77-78**: Element symbol (e.g., `C`, `O`).
''' 
''' ---
''' 
''' ### **Common Record Types**
''' | Record   | Description                                                               |
''' |----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
''' | `HEADER` | Molecular type, deposition date, and PDB ID (e.g., `1ABC`).               |
''' | `TITLE`  | Title of the structure.                                                   |
''' | `COMPND` | Molecular components in the entry (e.g., protein, ligand, ion).           |
''' | `SEQRES` | Amino acid/nucleotide sequence of the macromolecule.                      |
''' | `ATOM`   | 3D coordinates of standard residues (e.g., amino acids in a protein).     |
''' | `HETATM` | Coordinates of heteroatoms (non-standard residues: ligands, water, ions). |
''' | `HELIX`  | Details of α-helices.                                                     |
''' | `SHEET`  | Details of β-sheets.                                                      |
''' | `CONECT` | Bonds between atoms not covered by standard residue templates.            |
''' | `REMARK` | Annotations, experimental details, or warnings.                           |
''' 
''' ---
''' 
''' ### **Limitations**
''' - **Column Width Restrictions**: Legacy format limits data fields (e.g., residue numbers up to 9999, atom serial numbers up to 99,999).  
''' - **Sparse Connectivity Data**: Bonds are often inferred rather than explicitly listed.  
''' - **No Support for Large Structures**: Superseded by the **mmCIF/PDBx format** (more flexible, supports larger datasets).
''' 
''' ---
''' 
''' ### **Modernization: mmCIF/PDBx Format**
''' The PDB now prioritizes the **mmCIF format** (Macromolecular Crystallographic Information File), which 
''' uses a flexible, key-value-based structure without column limits. Legacy PDB files are automatically 
''' converted to mmCIF for archiving.
''' 
''' ---
''' 
''' ### **Tools for Viewing/Editing**
''' - **Visualization**: PyMOL, Chimera, VMD, RCSB PDB Viewer.  
''' - **Analysis**: BioPython, MDAnalysis.  
''' - **Database Access**: [RCSB PDB website](https://www.rcsb.org/) (search, download, and explore entries).
