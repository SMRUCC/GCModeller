# The OBO Foundry

The OBO Foundry is a collective of ontology developers that are committed to collaboration and adherence to shared principles. The mission of the OBO Foundry is to develop a family of interoperable ontologies that are both logically well-formed and scientifically accurate. To achieve this, OBO Foundry participants voluntarily adhere to and contribute to the development of an evolving set of principles including open use, collaborative development, non-overlapping and strictly-scoped content, and common syntax and relations, based on ontology models that work well, such as the Gene Ontology (GO).
The OBO Foundry is overseen by an Operations Committee with Editorial, Technical and Outreach working groups. The processes of the Editorial working group are modelled on the journal refereeing process. A complete treatment of the OBO Foundry is given in "The OBO Foundry: coordinated evolution of ontologies to support biomedical data integration".
On this site you will find a table of ontologies, available in several formats, with details for each, and documentation on OBO Principles.
