xcb00780,Metabolism,"Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins",00780,"Biotin (vitamin H or vitamin B7) is the essential cofactor of biotin-dependent carboxylases, such as pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Mammals cannot synthesize biotin, while in bacteria, fungi, and plants it is synthesized from pimelate thioester through different pathways. In E. coli and many organisms, pimelate thioester is derived from malonyl-ACP. The pathway starts with the methylation to malonyl-ACP methyl ester, followed by the fatty acid chain elongation cycle to form pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester, which is then demethylated to form pimeloyl-ACP [MD:M00572]. Pimeloyl-ACP is converted to biotin through the final four steps in the biotin bicyclic ring assembly, which are conserved among biotin-producing organisms [MD:M00123]. In B. subtilis, biotin is derived from pimeloyl-ACP formed by oxidative cleavage of long-chain acyl-ACPs [MD:M00573]. Some bacteria synthesize biotin from pimeloyl-CoA derived from pimelate [MD:M00577]. Biotin is covalently attached to biotin-dependent carboxylase by biotin protein ligase, also known as holocarboxylase synthase in mammals, to form an active holocarboxylase. After degradation of the biotinylated carboxylase into biocytin, it is further degraded by biotinidase to release free biotin, which is recycled in holocarboxylase synthesis. Biotin is catabolized by beta-oxidation of the valeric acid side chain or oxidation of sulfur in the heterocyclic ring.<br>","xcb:XC_0395; xcb:XC_0396; xcb:XC_0397; xcb:XC_0399; xcb:XC_0400; xcb:XC_0429; xcb:XC_1225; xcb:XC_2553; xcb:XC_2876; xcb:XC_3225; xcb:XC_3227; xcb:XC_3646; xcb:XC_3652; xcb:XC_4026; xcb:XC_4087; xcb:XC_4092"

Two-component pathways thus often enable cells to sense and respond to stimuli by inducing changes in transcription.<br>","xcb:XC_0001; xcb:XC_0194; xcb:XC_0195; xcb:XC_0197; xcb:XC_0198; xcb:XC_0204; xcb:XC_0286; xcb:XC_0336; xcb:XC_0486; xcb:XC_0626; xcb:XC_0638; xcb:XC_0647; xcb:XC_0648; xcb:XC_0812; xcb:XC_0813; xcb:XC_0820; xcb:XC_0828; xcb:XC_0843; xcb:XC_1005; xcb:XC_1058; xcb:XC_1059; xcb:XC_1061; xcb:XC_1062; xcb:XC_1074; xcb:XC_1183; xcb:XC_1184; xcb:XC_1185; xcb:XC_1186; xcb:XC_1187; xcb:XC_1188; xcb:XC_1190; xcb:XC_1235; xcb:XC_1290; xcb:XC_1295; xcb:XC_1300; xcb:XC_1301; xcb:XC_1311; xcb:XC_1409; xcb:XC_1410; xcb:XC_1412; xcb:XC_1413; xcb:XC_1414; xcb:XC_1419; xcb:XC_1421; xcb:XC_1454; xcb:XC_1455; xcb:XC_1519; xcb:XC_1768; xcb:XC_1770; xcb:XC_1792; xcb:XC_1793; xcb:XC_1794; xcb:XC_1801; xcb:XC_1802; xcb:XC_1884; xcb:XC_1885; xcb:XC_1937; xcb:XC_2045; xcb:XC_2130; xcb:XC_2136; xcb:XC_2163; xcb:XC_2223; xcb:XC_2233; xcb:XC_2245; xcb:XC_2251; xcb:XC_2253; xcb:XC_2281; xcb:XC_2282; xcb:XC_2284; xcb:XC_2297; xcb:XC_2300; xcb:XC_2302; xcb:XC_2303; xcb:XC_2304; xcb:XC_2307; xcb:XC_2308; xcb:XC_2309; xcb:XC_2311; xcb:XC_2313; xcb:XC_2314; xcb:XC_2315; xcb:XC_2316; xcb:XC_2318; xcb:XC_2320; xcb:XC_2321; xcb:XC_2323; xcb:XC_2332; xcb:XC_2333; xcb:XC_2335; xcb:XC_2456; xcb:XC_2457; xcb:XC_2504; xcb:XC_2506; xcb:XC_2564; xcb:XC_2707; xcb:XC_2708; xcb:XC_2855; xcb:XC_2916; xcb:XC_2943; xcb:XC_2972; xcb:XC_3058; xcb:XC_3059; xcb:XC_3111; xcb:XC_3197; xcb:XC_3272; xcb:XC_3273; xcb:XC_3528; xcb:XC_3529; xcb:XC_3530; xcb:XC_3531; xcb:XC_3532; xcb:XC_3724; xcb:XC_3757; xcb:XC_3762; xcb:XC_3763; xcb:XC_3823; xcb:XC_3859; xcb:XC_3860; xcb:XC_3861; xcb:XC_3873; xcb:XC_3897; xcb:XC_3957; xcb:XC_3997; xcb:XC_3998; xcb:XC_4030; xcb:XC_4031; xcb:XC_4058; xcb:XC_4059; xcb:XC_4131; xcb:XC_4326"

Generally, DNA replication follows a multistep enzymatic pathway. At the DNA replication fork, a DNA helicase (DnaB or MCM complex) precedes the DNA synthetic machinery and unwinds the duplex parental DNA in cooperation with the SSB or RPA. On the leading strand, replication occurs continuously in a 5 to 3 direction, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA replication occurs discontinuously by synthesis and joining of short Okazaki fragments. In prokaryotes, the leading strand replication apparatus consists of a DNA polymerase (pol III core), a sliding clamp (beta), and a clamp loader (gamma delta complex). The DNA primase (DnaG) is needed to form RNA primers. Normally, during replication of the lagging-strand DNA template, an RNA primer is removed either by an RNase H or by the 5 to 3 exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments. In eukaryotes, three DNA polymerases (alpha, delta, and epsilon) have been identified. DNA primase forms a permanent complex with DNA polymerase alpha.

xcb01502,"Human Diseases","Drug resistance",01502,"Vancomycin (VCM) is a glycopeptide antibiotic agent that inhibits the synthesis of peptidolgycan in the production of bacterial cell walls. It is active in most Gram-positive bacteria and acts by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala C-terminus of pentapeptide, thus blocking the addition of subunits to the peptidoglycan backbone. The resistance to VCM was first described among enterococci in the late 1980s in Europe. Subsequently, vancomycin-resistant enteococci (VRE) have been observed in many countries. The genes encoding resistance are carried on plasmids that can tranfer themselves from cell to cell and on tranponsons that can jump from plamids to the chromosome. Up to now, at least six resistance operon types are characterized, namely VanA, VanB, VanC, VanD, VanE and VanG. The VanA and VanB operons are detected on plasmids or in the chromosome, whereas the rest are found in the chromosome. In addition, Streptomyces, which is non-pathogenic, non-glycopeptide-producing actinomycete, also shows high-level resistance to VCM. In Streptomyces, novel genes (vanK and vanJ) are characterized with no counterparts found in the resistance clusters of pathogenic bacteria.<br> The expression of vancomycin resistance pathway is induced by the VanS-VanR two component system, and D-Ala-D-Lac or D-Ala-D-Ser dipsipeptides are formed in place of D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide. Thus, VCM cannot bind to pentadepsipeptide[D-Lac] or pentadepsipeptide[D-Ser]. The D-Ala-D-Lac variation shows high levels of resistance to VCM, especially in VanA type, wheras the D-Ala-D-Ser variation shows low levels of resistance.

The increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is also a regulator for production of reactive oxygen species and localized programmed cell death/hypersensitive response. The secondary response is called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Pathogens can acquire the ability to suppress PTI by directly injecting effector proteins into the plant cell through secretion systems. In addition, pathogens can manipulate plant hormone signaling pathways to evade host immune responses using coronatine toxin.

All of the moieties are derived from D-glucose. The streptidine moiety is synthesized via myo-inositol, which is then oxidized at C-1 and transaminated to give scyllo-inosamine. After phosphorylation, the compound is transamidinated by arginine. The same procedure is repeated at the C-3 position. The streptose moiety is made from D-glucose via a dTDP-glucose pathway.

Sulfur occurs in various oxidation states ranging from +6 in sulfate to -2 in sulfide (H2S). Sulfate reduction can occur in both an energy consuming assimilatory pathway and an energy producing dissimilatory pathway. The assimilatory pathway, which is found in a wide range of organisms, produces reduced sulfur compounds for the biosynthesis of S-containing amino acids and does not lead to direct excretion of sulfide. In the dissimilatory pathway, which is restricted to obligatory anaerobic bacterial and archaeal lineages, sulfate (or sulfur) is the terminal electron acceptor of the respiratory chain producing large quantities of inorganic sulfide. Both pathways start from the activation of sulfate by reaction with ATP to form adenylyl sulfate (APS). In the assimilatory pathway [MD:M00176] APS is converted to 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) and then reduced to sulfite, and sulfite is further reduced to sulfide by the assimilatory sulfite reductase. In the dissimilatory pathway [MD:M00596] APS is directly reduced to sulfite, and sulfite is further reduced to sulfide by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase. The capacity for oxidation of sulfur is quite widespread among bacteria and archaea, comprising phototrophs and chemolithoautotrophs. The SOX (sulfur-oxidation) system [MD:M00595] is a well-known sulfur oxidation pathway and is found in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis with reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide and elemental sulfur, as well as thiosulfate (in some species with the SOX system), as the electron donor for photoautotrophic growth. In some chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers (such as Thiobacillus denitrificans), it has been suggested that dissimilatory sulfur reduction enzymes operate in the reverse direction, forming a sulfur oxidation pathway from sulfite to APS and then to sulfate.<br>","xcb:XC_0328; xcb:XC_0982; xcb:XC_0990; xcb:XC_0991; xcb:XC_0992; xcb:XC_0993; xcb:XC_0994; xcb:XC_1227; xcb:XC_1252; xcb:XC_1334; xcb:XC_2564; xcb:XC_2697; xcb:XC_3292; xcb:XC_3293; xcb:XC_3294; xcb:XC_3295; xcb:XC_3456; xcb:XC_3655; xcb:XC_4044"
