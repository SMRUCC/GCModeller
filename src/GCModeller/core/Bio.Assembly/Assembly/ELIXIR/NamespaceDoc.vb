    ''' ## ELIXIR Core Data Resources
    ''' 
    ''' ELIXIR Core Data Resources are a set of European data resources of fundamental importance to 
    ''' the wider life-science community and the long-term preservation of biological data.
    '''
    ''' Identification of the ELIXIR Core Data Resources involves a careful evaluation of the 
    ''' multiple facets of the data resources. Indicators used in the evaluation are grouped into 
    ''' five categories:
    '''
    ''' + Scientific focus And quality Of science
    ''' + Community served by the resource
    ''' + Quality of service
    ''' + Legal And funding infrastructure, And governance
    ''' + Impact And translational stories
    ''' 
    ''' The details Of the selection criteria are described In the F1000R ELIXIR track article 
    ''' 'Identifying ELIXIR Core Data Resources'. The initial Core Data Resource list was defined 
    ''' in July of 2017. For a summary of that process, watch the ELIXIR webinar presented in 
    ''' September 2017. The list will be reviewed regularly.
    '''
    ''' ELIXIR Is committed to Open Access as a core principle for publicly funded research. 
    ''' ELIXIR Core Data Resources should reflect this commitment And have terms of use Or a 
    ''' licence that enables the reuse And remixing of data. The Creative Commons licenses CC0, 
    ''' CC-BY Or CC-BY-SA are all conformant with the Open Definition (http//opendefinition.org/licenses/), 
    ''' as are equivalent open terms of use.1
