    ''' <summary>
    ''' Frames in the class Enzymatic-Reactions describe attributes of an enzyme with respect 
    ''' to a particular reaction. For reactions that are catalyzed by more than one enzyme, 
    ''' or for enzymes that catalyze more than one reaction, multiple Enzymatic-Reactions 
    ''' frames are created, one for each enzyme/reaction pair. For example, Enzymatic-Reactions 
    ''' frames can represent the fact that two enzymes that catalyze the same reaction may be 
    ''' controlled by different activators and inhibitors.
