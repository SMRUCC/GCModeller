    ''' <summary>
    ''' Frames within the Reactions class describe properties of a biochemical reaction independent
    ''' of any enzyme or enzymes that catalyze that reaction. A reaction is a biochemical
    ''' transformation that interconverts two sets of chemical compounds (which includes small
    ''' metabolites, proteins, and DNA regions), and may translocate compounds from one cellular
    ''' compartment to another. Most reactions are written in a conventional direction that
    ''' has been assigned by the Enzyme Nomenclature Commission, but that direction may or
    ''' may not be the predominate physiological direction of the reaction. Reaction substrates
    ''' can include small-molecular-weight compounds (for metabolic reactions), proteins (such
    ''' as in signaling pathways), and DNA sites (such as for reactions involving binding of transcription
    ''' factors to DNA).
