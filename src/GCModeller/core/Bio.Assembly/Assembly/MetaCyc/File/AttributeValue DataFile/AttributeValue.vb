    ''' <summary>
    ''' Attribute-Value: Each attribute-value file contains data for one class of objects,
    ''' such as genes or proteins. A file is divided into entries, where one entry describes
    ''' one database object.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' An entry consists of a set of attribute-value pairs, •which describe properties of
    ''' the object, and relationships of the object to other object. Each attribute-value
    ''' pair typically resides on a single line of the file, although in some cases for
    ''' values that are long strings, the value will reside on multiple lines. An attribute-
    ''' value pair consists of an attribute name, followed by the string " - " and a value,
    ''' for example:
    '''
    ''' LEFT - NADP
    '''
    ''' A value that requires more than one line is continued by a newline followed by a /.
    ''' Thus, literal slashes at the beginning of a line must be escaped as //. A line that
    ''' contains only // separates objects. Comment lines can be anywhere in the file and
    ''' must begin with the following symbol:
    '''
    ''' #
    '''
    ''' Starting in version 6.5 of Pathway Tools, attribute-value files can also contain
    ''' annotation-value pairs. Annotations are a mechanism for attaching labeled values
    ''' to specific attribute values. For example, we might want to specify a coefficient
    ''' for a reactant in a chemical reaction. An annotations refers to the attribute value
    ''' that immediately precedes the annotation.
    ''' An annotation-value pair consists of a caret symbol "^" that points upward to indicate
    ''' that the annotation annotates the preceding attribute value, followed by the annotation
    ''' label, followed by the string " - ", followed by a value. The same attribute name or
    ''' annotation label with different values can appear any number of times in an object.
    ''' An example annotation-value pair that refers to the preceding attribute-value pair is:
    '''
    ''' LEFT - NADP
    ''' ^COEFFICIENT - 1
    ''' </remarks>
