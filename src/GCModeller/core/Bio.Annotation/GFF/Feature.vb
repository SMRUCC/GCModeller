    ''' (Feature是基因组序列片段之上的一个具备有生物学功能意义的区域，故而这个对象继承自核酸位点对象)
    ''' 
    ''' In the case of RNA-Seq, the features are typically genes, where each gene is considered here as the union of all its exons. 
    ''' One may also consider each exon as a feature, e.g., in order to check for alternative splicing.

    ''' For comparative ChIP-Seq, the features might be binding region from a pre-determined list.

        ''' From version 2 onwards, the attribute field must have an tag value structure following the syntax used within objects in 
        ''' a .ace file, flattened onto one line by semicolon separators. Tags must be standard identifiers ([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*). 
        ''' Free text values must be quoted with double quotes. Note: all non-printing characters in such free text value strings 
        ''' (e.g. newlines, tabs, control characters, etc) must be explicitly represented by their C (UNIX) style backslash-escaped

        ''' to establish consistent use of particular tags, corresponding to an underlying implied ACEDB model if you want to think 
        ''' that way (but acedb is not required). Examples of these would be:
