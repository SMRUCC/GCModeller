# The biom file format

The BIOM project consists of two independent tools: the ``biom-format`` software package, which contains software tools for working with BIOM-formatted files and the tables they represent; and the BIOM file format. As of the ``1.0.0`` software version and the ``1.0`` file format version, the version of the software and the file format are independent of one another. Version specific documentation of the file formats can be found on the following pages.

Release versions contain three integers in the following format: ``major-version.minor-version.micro-version``. When ``-dev`` is appended to the end of a version string that indicates a development (or between-release version). For example, ``1.0.0-dev`` would refer to the development version following the 1.0.0 release.
