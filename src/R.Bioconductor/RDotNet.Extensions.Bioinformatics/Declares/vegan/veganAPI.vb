    ''' ### Community Ecology Package: Ordination, Diversity and Dissimilarities
    ''' 
    ''' The vegan package provides tools for descriptive community ecology. It has most basic functions of diversity analysis, 
    ''' community ordination and dissimilarity analysis. Most of its multivariate tools can be used for other data types as 
    ''' well.
    ''' 
    ''' The functions in the vegan package contain tools for diversity analysis, ordination methods and tools for the analysis 
    ''' of dissimilarities. Together with the labdsv package, the vegan package provides most standard tools of descriptive 
    ''' community analysis. Package ade4 provides an alternative comprehensive package, and several other packages complement 
    ''' vegan and provide tools for deeper analysis in specific fields. Package BiodiversityR provides a GUI for a large subset 
    ''' of vegan functionality.
    ''' 
    ''' The vegan package Is developed at GitHub (https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/). GitHub provides up-to-date information 
    ''' And forums for bug reports.
    ''' 
    ''' Most important changes In vegan documents can be read With news(package="vegan") And vignettes can be browsed With 
    ''' browseVignettes("vegan"). The vignettes include a vegan FAQ, discussion On design decisions, Short introduction To 
    ''' ordination And discussion On diversity methods. A tutorial Of the package at http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/opetus/metodi/vegantutor.pdf 
    ''' provides a more thorough introduction to the package.
    ''' 
    ''' To see the preferable citation of the package, type citation("vegan").
