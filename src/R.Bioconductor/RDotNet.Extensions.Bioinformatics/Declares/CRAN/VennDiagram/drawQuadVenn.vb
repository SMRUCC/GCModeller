Namespace VennDiagram

    ''' <summary>
    '''Creates a Venn diagram with four sets.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The function defaults to placing the ellipses so that area1 corresponds to lower left,
    ''' area2 corresponds to lower right, area3 corresponds to middle left and area4 corresponds
    ''' to middle right. Refer to the example below to see how the 31 partial areas are ordered.
    ''' Arguments with length of 15 (label.col, cex, fontface, fontfamily) will follow the order
    ''' in the example.
    '''
    ''' Value
    '''
    ''' Returns an Object Of Class gList containing the grid objects that make up the diagram.
    ''' Also displays the diagram In a graphical device unless specified With ind = False.
    ''' Grid:grid.draw can be used to draw the gList object in a graphical device.
