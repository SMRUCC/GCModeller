        ''' like watching a Geiger counter. The data for a subject is presented as multiple rows or 
        ''' "observations", each of which applies to an interval of observation (start, stop].
        ''' 
        ''' The routine internally scales and centers data to avoid overflow in the argument to the 
        ''' exponential function. These actions do not change the result, but lead to more numerical 
        ''' stability. However, arguments to offset are not scaled since there are situations where a 
        ''' large offset value is a purposefully used. Users should not use normally allow large numeric 
        ''' offset values.
