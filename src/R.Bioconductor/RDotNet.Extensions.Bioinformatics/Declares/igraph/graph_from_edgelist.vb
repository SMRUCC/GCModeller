    ''' graph_from_edgelist creates a graph from an edge list. Its argument is a two-column matrix, each row defines one edge.
    ''' If it is a numeric matrix then its elements are interpreted as vertex ids.
    ''' If it is a character matrix then it is interpreted as symbolic vertex names and a vertex id will be assigned to each name, and also a name vertex attribute will be added.
