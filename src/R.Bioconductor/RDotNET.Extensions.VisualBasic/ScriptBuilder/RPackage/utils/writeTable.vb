    ''' write.table prints its required argument x (after converting it to a data frame if it is not one nor a matrix) to a file or connection.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' If the table has no columns the rownames will be written only if row.names = TRUE, and vice versa.
    ''' Real And complex numbers are written to the maximal possible precision.
    ''' If a data frame has matrix-Like columns these will be converted To multiple columns In the result (via As.matrix) And so a character col.names Or a numeric quote should refer To the columns In the result, Not the input. Such matrix-Like columns are unquoted by Default.
    ''' Any columns In a data frame which are lists Or have a Class (e.g., dates) will be converted by the appropriate As.character method: such columns are unquoted by Default. 
    ''' On the other hand, any Class information For a matrix Is discarded And non-atomic (e.g., list) matrices are coerced To character.
    ''' Only columns which have been converted To character will be quoted If specified by quote.
    ''' The dec argument only applies To columns that are Not subject To conversion To character because they have a Class Or are part Of a matrix-Like column (Or matrix), In particular To columns Protected by I(). Use options("OutDec") To control such conversions.
    ''' In almost all cases the conversion of numeric quantities Is governed by the option "scipen" (see options), but with the internal equivalent of digits = 15. 
    ''' For finer control, use format to make a character matrix/data frame, And call write.table on that.
    ''' These functions check For a user interrupt every 1000 lines Of output.
    ''' If file Is a non-open connection, an attempt Is made To open it And Then close it after use.
    ''' To write a Unix-style file on Windows, use a binary connection e.g. file = file("filename", "wb").
