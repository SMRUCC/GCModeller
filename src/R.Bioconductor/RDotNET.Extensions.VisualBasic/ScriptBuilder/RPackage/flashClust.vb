    ''' <summary>
    ''' Faster alternative to hclust.
    ''' This function implements optimal hierarchical clustering with the same interface as hclust.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' See the description of hclust for details on available clustering methods.
    '''
    ''' If members! = NULL, Then d Is taken To be a dissimilarity matrix between clusters instead Of dissimilarities between singletons And members gives the number Of observations per cluster. 
    ''' This way the hierarchical cluster algorithm can be 'started in the middle of the dendrogram’, e.g., in order to reconstruct the part of the tree above a cut (see examples). 
    ''' Dissimilarities between clusters can be efficiently computed (i.e., without hclust itself) only for a limited number of distance/linkage combinations, the simplest one being squared Euclidean distance and centroid linkage. 
    ''' In this case the dissimilarities between the clusters are the squared Euclidean distances between cluster means.
    ''' flashClust Is a wrapper for compatibility with older code.
