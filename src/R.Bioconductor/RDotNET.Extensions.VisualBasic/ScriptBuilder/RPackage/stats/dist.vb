        ''' <remarks>
        ''' Available distance measures are (written for two vectors x and y):
        ''' 
        ''' euclidean:
        ''' Usual distance between the two vectors (2 norm aka L_2), sqrt(sum((x_i - y_i)^2)).
        '''
        ''' maximum:
        ''' Maximum distance between two components Of x And y (supremum norm)
        '''
        ''' manhattan:
        ''' Absolute distance between the two vectors (1 norm aka L_1).
        ''' 
        ''' canberra:
        ''' sum(|x_i - y_i| / |x_i + y_i|). Terms with zero numerator And denominator are omitted from the sum And treated as if the values were missing.
        ''' 
        ''' This Is intended for non-negative values (e.g., counts): taking the absolute value Of the denominator Is a 1998 R modification To avoid negative distances.
        ''' 
        ''' binary:
        ''' (aka asymmetric binary): The vectors are regarded As binary bits, so non-zero elements are 'on’ and zero elements are ‘off’. 
        ''' The distance is the proportion of bits in which only one is on amongst those in which at least one is on.
        '''
        ''' minkowski:
        ''' The p norm, the pth root Of the sum Of the pth powers Of the differences Of the components.
        '''
        ''' Missing values are allowed, And are excluded from all computations involving the rows within which they occur. 
        ''' Further, When Inf values are involved, all pairs Of values are excluded When their contribution To the distance gave NaN Or NA. 
        ''' If some columns are excluded In calculating a Euclidean, Manhattan, Canberra Or Minkowski distance, the sum Is scaled up proportionally To the number Of columns used.
