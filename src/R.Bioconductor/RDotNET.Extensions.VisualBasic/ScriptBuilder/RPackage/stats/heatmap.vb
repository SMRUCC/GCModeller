    ''' <summary>
    ''' A heat map is a false color image (basically image(t(x))) with a dendrogram added to the left side and to the top. Typically, reordering of the rows and columns according to some set of values (row or column means) within the restrictions imposed by the dendrogram is carried out.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' If either Rowv or Colv are dendrograms they are honored (and not reordered). Otherwise, dendrograms are computed as dd &lt;- as.dendrogram(hclustfun(distfun(X))) where X is either x or t(x).
    ''' If either Is a vector (Of 'weights’) then the appropriate dendrogram is reordered according to the supplied values subject to the constraints imposed by the dendrogram, by reorder(dd, Rowv), in the row case. If either is missing, as by default, then the ordering of the corresponding dendrogram is by the mean value of the rows/columns, i.e., in the case of rows, Rowv &lt;- rowMeans(x, na.rm = na.rm). If either is NA, no reordering will be done for the corresponding side.
    ''' By Default (scale = "row") the rows are scaled to have mean zero And standard deviation one. There Is some empirical evidence from genomic plotting that this Is useful.
    ''' The Default colors are Not pretty. Consider Using enhancements such As the RColorBrewer package.
