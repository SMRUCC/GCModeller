    ''' Generic function for plotting of R objects. For more details about the graphical parameter arguments, see par.
    ''' For simple scatter plots, plot.default will be used. 
    ''' However, there are plot methods for many R objects, including functions, data.frames, density objects, etc. Use methods(plot) And the documentation for these.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The two step types differ in their x-y preference: Going from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) with x1 &lt; x2, type = "s" moves first horizontal, then vertical, whereas type = "S" moves the other way around.
