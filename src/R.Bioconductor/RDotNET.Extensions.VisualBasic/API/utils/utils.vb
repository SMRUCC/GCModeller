        ''' <remarks>
        ''' Currently, four formats of data files are supported:
        '''
        ''' + files ending '.R’ or ‘.r’ are source()d in, with the R working directory changed temporarily to the directory containing the respective file. (data ensures that the utils package is attached, in case it had been run via utils::data.)
        ''' + files ending '.RData’ or ‘.rda’ are load()ed.
        ''' + files ending '.tab’, ‘.txt’ or ‘.TXT’ are read using read.table(..., header = TRUE), and hence result in a data frame.
        ''' + files ending '.csv’ or ‘.CSV’ are read using read.table(..., header = TRUE, sep = ";"), and also result in a data frame.
        ''' 
        ''' If more than one matching file name Is found, the first On this list Is used. (Files With extensions '.txt’, ‘.tab’ or ‘.csv’ can be compressed, with or without further extension ‘.gz’, ‘.bz2’ or ‘.xz’.)
        ''' The data sets To be loaded can be specified As a Set Of character strings Or names, Or As the character vector list, Or As both.
        ''' For Each given data set, the first two types ('.R’ or ‘.r’, and ‘.RData’ or ‘.rda’ files) can create several variables in the load environment, which might all be named differently from the data set. The third and fourth types will always result in the creation of a single variable with the same name (without extension) as the data set.
        ''' 
        ''' + If no data sets are specified, data lists the available data sets. It looks For a New-style data index In the 'Meta’ or, if this is not found, an old-style ‘00Index’ file in the ‘data’ directory of each specified package, and uses these files to prepare a listing. If there is a ‘data’ area but no index, available data files for loading are computed and included in the listing, and a warning is given: such packages are incomplete. The information about available data sets is returned in an object of class "packageIQR". The structure of this class is experimental. Where the datasets have a different name from the argument that should be used to retrieve them the index will have an entry like beaver1 (beavers) which tells us that dataset beaver1 can be retrieved by the call data(beaver).
        ''' + If ``lib.loc`` And package are both NULL (the default), the data sets are searched for in all the currently loaded packages Then In the 'data’ directory (if any) of the current working directory.
        ''' + If ``lib.loc = NULL`` but package Is specified as a character vector, the specified package(s) are searched for first amongst loaded packages And Then In the Default library/ies (see .libPaths).
        ''' + If ``lib.loc`` Is specified (And Not NULL), packages are searched for in the specified library/ies, even if they are already loaded from another library.
        ''' 
        ''' To just look in the 'data’ directory of the current working directory, set package = character(0) (and lib.loc = NULL, the default).
