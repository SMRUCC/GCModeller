    ''' <summary>
    ''' Estimate the size factors for a DESeqDataSet
    '''
    ''' This function estimates the size factors using the "median ratio method" described by Equation 5 in Anders and Huber (2010).
    ''' The estimated size factors can be accessed using sizeFactors.
    ''' Alternative library size estimators can also be supplied using sizeFactors.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' Typically, the function is called with the idiom:
    '''
    ''' dds &lt;- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
    '''
    ''' See DESeq For a description Of the use Of size factors In the GLM.
    ''' One should Call this Function after DESeqDataSet unless size factors are manually specified With sizeFactors.
    ''' Alternatively, gene-specific normalization factors For Each sample can be provided Using normalizationFactors
    ''' which will always preempt sizeFactors In calculations.
    '''
    ''' Internally, the function calls estimateSizeFactorsForMatrix, which provides more details on the calculation.

    ''' Low-level function to estimate size factors with robust regression.

    ''' Given a matrix or data frame of count data, this function estimates the size factors as follows:
    ''' Each column is divided by the geometric means of the rows. The median (or, if requested,
    ''' another location estimator) of these ratios (skipping the genes with a geometric mean of zero)
