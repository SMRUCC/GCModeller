Namespace DESeq2

    ''' <summary>
    ''' Differential expression analysis based on the Negative Binomial (a.k.a. Gamma-Poisson) distribution
    '''
    ''' This function performs a default analysis through the steps:
    '''
    ''' 1. estimation of size factors estimateSizeFactors
    ''' 2. estimation of dispersion estimateDispersions
    ''' 3. Negative Binomial GLM fitting And Wald statistics: nbinomWaldTest
    '''
    ''' For complete details on each step, see the manual pages of the respective functions.
    ''' After the DESeq function returns a DESeqDataSet object, results tables (log2 fold changes And p-values) can be
    ''' generated using the results function. See the manual page for results for information on independent filtering
    ''' And p-value adjustment for multiple test correction.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' a DESeqDataSet object with results stored as metadata columns. These results should accessed by calling the results function.
    ''' By default this will return the log2 fold changes and p-values for the last variable in the design formula.
    ''' See results for how to access results for other variables.
    ''' </remarks>
