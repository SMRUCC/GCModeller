    ''' <summary>
    ''' FASTQ format is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and 
    ''' its corresponding quality scores. Both the sequence letter and quality score are each encoded with a single 
    ''' ASCII character for brevity. It was originally developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to bundle a 
    ''' FASTA sequence and its quality data, but has recently become the de facto standard for storing the output of 
    ''' high-throughput sequencing instruments such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer.
    ''' 
    ''' There is no standard file extension for a FASTQ file, but .fq and .fastq, are commonly used.
    ''' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format)
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' A FASTQ file normally uses four lines per sequence.
    ''' 
    ''' + Line 1 begins with a '@' character and is followed by a sequence identifier and an optional description (like a FASTA title line).
    ''' + Line 2 is the raw sequence letters.
    ''' + Line 3 begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any description) again.
    ''' + Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in Line 2, and must contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence.
    ''' 
    ''' > + header
    ''' > + seuqnece
    ''' > + ``+``
    ''' > + quality

    ''' 一条FastQ序列文件通常使用4行代表一条序列数据：
    ''' + 第一行： 起始于@字符，后面跟随着序列的标识符，以及一段可选的摘要描述信息
    ''' + 第二行： 原始的序列
    ''' + 第三行： 起始于+符号，与第一行的作用类似
    ''' + 第四行： 编码了第二行的序列数据的质量高低，长度与第二行相同
