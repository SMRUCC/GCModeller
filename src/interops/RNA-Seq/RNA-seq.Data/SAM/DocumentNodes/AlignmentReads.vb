        ''' 
        ''' Hello, I have 40,637 short sequences (probes) in a fastq file named "seq.fq".
        ''' 
        ''' • First, I mapped them against a reference genome (hg19) using BWA ("bwa aln ...").
        ''' • Then, I converted the alignments from suffix-array coordinates into chromosomal coordinates ("bwa samse ..."), 
        '''   And obtained the results into a SAM file named "seq_aln.sam".
        ''' • Finally, I counted the number of occurrences for each flag
        ''' 
        ''' $ grep -v "@" seq_aln.sam | awk -F"\t" 'BEGIN{print "flag\toccurrences"} {a[$2]++} END{for(i in a)print i"\t"a[i]}'

        '''   4.........3083
        '''   0.........19039
        '''  16.........18515
        ''' 
        ''' According to this page, the "4" flag means that the short sequence doesn't map onto the reference genome, 
        ''' and the "16" flag means that the short sequence does map on the reverse strand of the reference genome.
        ''' 
        ''' But, what does the "0" flag mean? According to this forum page, it means "the read is not paired and mapped, 
        ''' forward strand", which Is unclear to me... Does it mean "it is not paired but it maps on forward strand"? 
        ''' Or "it is neither paired nor maps on forward strand"? Or "it is neither paired nor maps on any strand"?
        ''' 
        ''' At the End, does all this mean that I can work With only 18,515 Short sequences out Of 40,637?

        ''' Anwser Comments:
        ''' 
        ''' When the flag field Is 0, it means none of the bitwise flags specified in the SAM spec (on page 4) are set. 
        ''' That means that your reads with flag 0 are unpaired (because the first flag, 0x1, Is Not set), 
        ''' successfully mapped to the reference (because 0x4 Is Not set) And mapped to the forward strand (because 0x10 Is Not set).
        ''' 
        ''' Summarizing your data, the reads With flag 4 are unmapped, the reads With flag 0 are mapped To the forward strand 
        ''' And the reads With flag 16 are mapped To the reverse strand.
