<p>Cytoscape is an open source software project for integrating biomolecular interaction networks with high-throughput expression data and other molecular states into a unified 
                    conceptual framework. Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction 
                    with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. 
                    Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, 
                    and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, 
                    allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for 
                    interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a 
                    combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.
