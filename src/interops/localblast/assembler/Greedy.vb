    ' Given a Set Of sequence fragments the Object Is To find the shortest common supersequence.

    ' Сalculate pairwise alignments Of all fragments.
    ' Choose two fragments With the largest overlap.
    ' Merge chosen fragments.
    ' Repeat step 2 And 3 until only one fragment Is left.
    ' The result need Not be an optimal solution To the problem.
