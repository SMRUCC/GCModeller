This interface represents everything we need from a neuron in this
 Genetic Algorithm sample. We need it to execute and give a result
 for an input, we need it to be capable of reproducing and, for
 performance reasons, we want it to say how complex it is. The
 more complex cells lose points when analyzing how good it is the
 result generated by them (if they didn't found the result... in that
 case, they are the winners independently on how complex they are).
