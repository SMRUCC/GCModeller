    ''' defines the respective terminal points.

    ''' For edges, if the geometry is relative (default), then the x-coordinate
    ''' is used to describe the distance from the center of the edge from -1 to 1
    ''' with 0 being the center of the edge and the default value, and the
    ''' y-coordinate is used to describe the absolute, orthogonal distance in
    ''' pixels from that point. In addition, the offset is used as an absolute
    ''' offset vector from the resulting point.
