#### Example

Consider the linear program

With the addition of slack variables ``s`` and ``t``, this is represented by the canonical tableau

where columns 5 and 6 represent the basic variables ``s`` and ``t`` and the corresponding basic feasible solution is

Columns 2, 3, and 4 can be selected as pivot columns, for this example column 4 is selected. The values of ``z`` resulting from the choice of rows 2 and 3 as pivot rows are ``10/1 = 10`` and ``15/3 = 5`` respectively. Of these the minimum is 5, so row 3 must be the pivot row. Performing the pivot produces

Now columns 4 and 5 represent the basic variables ``z`` and ``s`` and the corresponding basic feasible solution is

For the next step, there are no positive entries in the objective row and in fact

so the minimum value of ``Z`` is âˆ’20.
