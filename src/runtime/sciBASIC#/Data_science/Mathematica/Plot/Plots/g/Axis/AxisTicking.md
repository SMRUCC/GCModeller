# An Algorithm for Creating and Selecting Graph Axes

> http://austinclemens.com/blog/2016/01/09/an-algorithm-for-creating-a-graphs-axes/

For an arbitrary set of data points, what’s the ``best`` graph axis for those points? Say that your x-variable runs from 5 to 45. A human can quickly pick a few promising options for the x-axis. It could have ticks at 0, 15, 30, and 45. Or perhaps 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. Getting a program to generate ``nice`` options like this is a bit trickier. I’ve been working on a graphing app recently and I’ve reproduced my solution, with notes, below.

Although there are a number of algorithms people have put forth on Stack Overflow and elsewhere, many of these do not handle certain kinds of data sets correctly, and virtually none treat 0 correctly in my opinion. I started from scratch with the following 5 rules for my function:

+ If an axis crosses 0, 0 *must* be an axis tick value
+ Axis ticks *must* be attached to a grid line (i.e. you can’t have x-axis ticks floating in space – they must be attached to a y-axis grid line as you see in the example above)
+ The data should be as tightly contained as possible (little wasted space)
+ There should be no fewer than 4 ticks on each axis, and if rule 2 requires it, up to 10
+ Numbers should be ``nice`` (round numbers etc.)

My Javascript algorithm is below with comments. The basic approach is to generate a large number of candidate axes, score each axis based on the amount of wasted space and the number of ticks used, and then compare these scores. It is a bit brute force in this way. Computation is cheap! It takes an array of data values as input – for example [0, 12, 8, 20, 5] or whatever.

First, get the minimum and maximum of the series, toggle the ``zero_flag`` variable if 0 is between the min and max, and get the range of the data.

```javascript
/*
 * function create_axis(dataseries) {...}
 */

var maxdata = Math.max(...dataseries);
var mindata = Math.min(...dataseries);
var zero_flag = 0;

if ( mindata<=0 && maxdata>=0 ) {
    zero_flag = 1;
}

var range = maxdata - mindata;
```

Next, define ``nice`` numbers. You could change this if you’d like to include other possibilities, but I decided I would allow counting by 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 25s, and 75s. This will make a bit more sense below.

```javascript
var nice_ticks = [.1,.2,.5,1,.15,.25,.75];
```

This next part is a bit of path dependence – I had an algorithm where the number of ticks was more central and I kept that framework but I probably wouldn’t do it this way again. I get a naive value for the distance between ticks and determine the place value of this distance.

```javascript
var steps = range / (ticks-1);
var digits;

if(steps >= 1) {
    rounded = Math.round(steps);
    digits  = rounded.toString().length;
} else {
    var places      = steps.toString().split('.')[1];
    var first_place = 0;

    for(var i=0; i<places.length; i++) {
        if (places[i]!='0' && first_place==0) {
            first_place = i;
        }
    }

    digits = -parseInt(first_place);
}
```

Now using the value of digits (the place value of steps), generate a list of candidate steps. These are just the values from ``nice_steps`` above multiplied by powers of 10 according to the place value of digits. Because computation doesn’t matter to me, I check ``10^place value+1``, ``10^place value``, and ``10^place value-1``. Most of these candidate step lengths will be terrible but it doesn’t matter – they will get weeded out in the next step. If our initial step length was 13, candidate steps will be generated by taking 1, 10 and 100 * all values of ``nice_ticks``. So 13 would result in candidate steps: [.1,.2,.5,1,.15,.25,.75,1,2,5,10,2.5,2.5,7.5,20,50,100,15,25,75]

```javascript
var candidate_steps = [];

for (var i=0; i < nice_ticks.length; i++) {
    candidate_steps.push(nice_ticks[i]*Math.pow(10,digits));
    candidate_steps.push(nice_ticks[i]*Math.pow(10,digits-1));
    candidate_steps.push(nice_ticks[i]*Math.pow(10,digits+1));
}
```

Loop through candidate steps and generate an axis based on each step length.

```javascript
for (var i=0; i<candidate_steps.length; i++) {

	steps=parseFloat(candidate_steps[i])

    // starting value depends on whether or not 0 is in the array
    if( zero_flag == 1 ) {
        min_steps  = Math.ceil(Math.abs(mindata)/steps);
        step_array = [-min_steps*steps];
    } else {
        step_array = [Math.floor(mindata/steps)*steps];
    }

    var stepnum = 1;

    while (step_array[step_array.length-1] < maxdata) {
        step_array.push((parseFloat(step_array[0])+steps*stepnum));
        stepnum++;
    }

    // this arbitrarily enforces step_arrays of length between 4 and 10
    if (step_array.length < 11 && step_array.length > 4) {
    	candidate_arrays.push(step_array)
    }
}
```

All that remains is to score all the candidate arrays. I’m not going to include my scorer, because there are a lot of arbitrary choices involved, but basically I look at how much space each array wastes compared to the data use that as a starting value. Each array gets the score 10^percent wasted space – then I further penalize the array for large values of ticks, tick values that I don’t like as much (.15 for example, is great in certain cases, but probably shouldn’t be liked as much by the function as .1). The array with the lowest score ``wins``.
