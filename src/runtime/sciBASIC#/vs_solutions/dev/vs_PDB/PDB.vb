''' <summary>
''' Program database (``PDB``) is a proprietary file format (developed by Microsoft) for storing debugging information 
''' about a program (or, commonly, program modules such as a DLL or EXE). PDB files commonly have a ``.pdb`` extension. 
''' A PDB file is typically created from source files during compilation. It stores a list of all symbols in a module 
''' with their addresses and possibly the name of the file and the line on which the symbol was declared. This symbol 
''' information is not stored in the module itself, because it takes up a lot of space.
