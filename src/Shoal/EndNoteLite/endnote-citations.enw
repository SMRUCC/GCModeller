%X Rfam is a collection of multiple sequence alignments and covariance models representing non-coding RNA families. Rfam is available on the web in the UK at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/ and in the US at http://rfam.wustl.edu/. These websites allow the user to search a query sequence against a library of covariance models, and view multiple sequence alignments and family annotation. The database can also be downloaded in flatfile form and searched locally using the INFERNAL package (http://infernal.wustl.edu/). The first release of Rfam (1.0) contains 25 families, which annotate over 50â€…000 non-coding RNA genes in the taxonomic divisions of the EMBL nucleotide database.
