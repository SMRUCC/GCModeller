.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
make filter of the background model
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBbackground\fB \fR\- -. 
.PP
.PP
\fBgeneSet\fB \fR\- usually be a character of the gene id set.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBmin_size\fB \fR\- the min feature size is required for each cluster. 
 all of the cluster that have the feature number less than this cutoff 
 will be removed from the background.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBmax_intersects\fB \fR\- the max intersect number that each cluster 
 intersect with the input geneSet. all of the clusters that greater than 
 this value will be removed from the background.. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
a new background model that has cluster filtered by the given rule.
