Gene Set Variation Analysis for microarray and RNA-seq data
 
 Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is a non-parametric, unsupervised 
 method for estimating variation of gene set enrichment through the
 samples of a expression data set. GSVA performs a change in coordinate
 systems, transforming the data from a gene by sample matrix to a gene-set
 by sample matrix, thereby allowing the evaluation of pathway enrichment 
 for each sample. This new matrix of GSVA enrichment scores facilitates
 applying standard analytical methods like functional enrichment, 
 survival analysis, clustering, CNV-pathway analysis or cross-tissue 
 pathway analysis, in a pathway-centric manner.
