.SH VALUE
.PP
this function returns a tuple list that contains the pattern 
 cluster matrix and the cmeans pattern plots.
 
 1. 'pattern' is a dataframe object that contains the object cluster patterns
 2. 'image' is a bitmap image that plot based on the object cluster patterns data.
 3. 'pdf' is a pdf image that could be edit
