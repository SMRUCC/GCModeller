.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIz_score(\fBmatrix\fR as <generic> Matrix);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
To avoid the influence of expression level to the 
 clustering analysis, z-score transformation can 
 be applied to covert the expression values to 
 z-scores by performing the following formula:
 
 \fB
 z = (x - u) / sd
 \fR`
 
 x is value to be converted (e.g., a expression value 
 of a genomic feature in one condition), µ is the 
 population mean (e.g., average expression value Of 
 a genomic feature In different conditions), σ Is the 
 standard deviation (e.g., standard deviation of 
 expression of a genomic feature in different conditions).
