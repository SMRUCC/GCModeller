# genomics_context

the tools for processing of the genomics context information

+ [set_context](genomics_context/set_context.1) 
+ [filter_strand](genomics_context/filter_strand.1) filter genes by given strand direction
+ [location](genomics_context/location.1) create a new nucleotide location object
+ [is.forward](genomics_context/is.forward.1) assert that does the given nucleotide location is in forward direction?
+ [offset](genomics_context/offset.1) do offset of the given location
+ [context](genomics_context/context.1) Create a new context model of a specific genomics feature site.
+ [relationship](genomics_context/relationship.1) get the segment relationship of two location
+ [TSS_upstream](genomics_context/TSS_upstream.1) get TSS upstream site sequence data
