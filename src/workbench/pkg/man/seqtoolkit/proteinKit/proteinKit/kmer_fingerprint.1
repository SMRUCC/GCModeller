.SH NAME
kmer_fingerprint \- Calculate the morgan fingerprint based on the k-mer graph data
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIkmer_fingerprint(\fBgraph\fR as <generic> KMerGraph, 
\fBradius\fR as integer = 3, 
\fBlen\fR as integer = 4096);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Calculate the morgan fingerprint based on the k-mer graph data 
 
 Generates fixed-length molecular fingerprint vectors from k-mer graphs using 
 Morgan algorithm with circular topology hashing.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBgraph\fB \fR\- The k-mer graph object to fingerprint. 
.PP
.PP
\fBradius\fB \fR\- Neighborhood radius for structural feature capture. Larger values 
 consider more distant node relationships. Default is 3.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBlen\fB \fR\- Output vector length (uses modulo hashing). Default 4096.. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
Integer array fingerprint where indices represent structural features
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
let seqs = read.fasta("./proteins.fa");
 # create protein sequence graph based on k-mer(k=3)
 let g = kmer_graph(seqs, k = 3);
 
 for(let kmer in g) {
     print(kmer |> kmer_fingerprint());
 }
