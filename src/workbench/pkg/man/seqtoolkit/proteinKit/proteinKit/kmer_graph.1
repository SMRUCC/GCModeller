.SH NAME
kmer_graph \- Constructs k-mer adjacency graphs from protein sequence data. Nodes represent k-length
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIkmer_graph(\fBprot\fR as any, 
\fBk\fR as integer = 3, 
[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Constructs k-mer adjacency graphs from protein sequence data. Nodes represent k-length 
 subsequences, edges connect k-mers appearing consecutively in the sequence.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBprot\fB \fR\- A FASTA sequence or collection of FASTA sequences to process.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBk\fB \fR\- The subsequence length parameter for k-mer generation. Default is 3.. 
.PP
.PP
\fBenv\fB \fR\- The R runtime environment for error handling and resource cleanup.. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
Returns a single @\fBT:SMRUCC.genomics.Model.MotifGraph.ProteinStructure.Kmer.KMerGraph\fR for single sequence input. Returns a named list 
 of KMerGraph objects for multiple sequences. Returns error message for invalid inputs.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
let graphs = kmer_graph(sequences, k = 3);
