.SH DETAILS
.PP
fasta title is build with a string template, there are some reserved template keyword for this function:
 
 1. ncbi_taxid - is the ncbi taxonomy id that extract from the genbank assembly
 2. lineage - taxonomy lineage in biom style string, which is extract from the genbank assembly its source information
 3. gb_asm_id - the ncbi accession id of the genbank assembly
 4. nucl_loc - the nucleotide sequence location on the genomics sequence
 
 ##### about the salmon duplicated id error
 
 if you encounter this error while build sequence index by using salmon tool, please set the \fBunique.names\fR parameter to TRUE
