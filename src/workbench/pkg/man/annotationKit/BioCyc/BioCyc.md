# BioCyc

The BioCyc database collection is an assortment of organism specific Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs) 
 that provide reference to genome and metabolic pathway information for thousands of organisms.
 As of July 2023, there were over 20,040 databases within BioCyc.[2] SRI International,[3] based in 
 Menlo Park, California, maintains the BioCyc database family.

+ [getGenes](BioCyc/getGenes.1) 
+ [getProteins](BioCyc/getProteins.1) 
+ [formula](BioCyc/formula.1) get formula string of the given object model
+ [db_links](BioCyc/db_links.1) get external database cross reference id of current metabolite compound object
