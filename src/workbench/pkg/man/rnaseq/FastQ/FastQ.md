# FastQ

FastQ toolkit
> FASTQ format Is a text-based format For storing both a biological sequence 
>  (usually nucleotide sequence) And its corresponding quality scores. Both 
>  the sequence letter And quality score are Each encoded With a Single ASCII 
>  character For brevity. It was originally developed at the Wellcome Trust 
>  Sanger Institute To bundle a FASTA formatted sequence And its quality data, 
>  but has recently become the de facto standard For storing the output Of 
>  high-throughput sequencing instruments such As the Illumina Genome 
>  Analyzer.
