        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>polyglot programming</p>

<p>Polyglot programming is the practice of writing code in multiple <br />
 languages to capture additional functionality and efficiency not <br />
 available in a single language. The use of domain specific languages<br />
 (DSLs) has become a standard practice for enterprise application<br />
 development. For example, a mobile development team might employ<br />
 Java, JavaScript and HTML5 to create a fully functional application.<br />
 Other DSLs such as SQL (for data queries), XML (embedded configuration)<br />
 and CSS (document formatting) are often built into enterprise <br />
 applications as well. One developer may be proficient in multiple <br />
 languages, or a team with varying language skills may work together <br />
 to perform polyglot programming.</p>

<p>Polyglot programming Is considered necessary When a Single, <br />
 general-purpose language cannot offer the desired level Of functionality <br />
 Or speed, interact properly With the database Or the desired delivery <br />
 platform, Or meet End user expectations. Proponents Of polyglot <br />
 programming contend that Using the most effective language For Each <br />
 aspect Of a program enables faster development, greater comprehension<br />
 For business stakeholders, And a more optimal End product. However,<br />
 integrating a wide variety Of languages into a Single application may<br />
 entail added complexity. Resource consumption may increase In terms<br />
 Of training, testing And maintenance. Polyglot programming may also<br />
 make code difficult To deploy If operations Is Not familiar With the<br />
 same languages used In development.</p>
