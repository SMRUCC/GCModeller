        <h3>Description</h3>

        <h5>GO as a Graph</h5>

<p>The Structure of GO can be described In terms Of a graph, where Each GO term Is a node, And the relationships between the terms are 
 edges between the nodes. GO Is loosely hierarchical, With 'child' terms being more specialized than their 'parent' terms, but unlike 
 a strict hierarchy, a term may have more than one parent term (note that the parent/child model does not hold true for all types of 
 relation)
 
 (功能定义,term相当于一个节点，节点之间的继承关系是非严格的，即某一个子节点可能会有多个父节点)</p>

<h4>Sample GO Term</h4>

<p>The following Is a GO term taken from the OBO format file.

<pre><code class=""> id: GO : 0016049
 name: cell growth
 Namespace:  biological_process
 def: "The process in which a cell irreversibly increases in size over time by accretion and biosynthetic production of matter similar to that already present." [GOC:ai]
 subset: goslim_generic
 subset: goslim_plant
 subset: gosubset_prok
 synonym: "cell expansion" RELATED []
 synonym: "cellular growth" EXACT []
 synonym: "growth of cell" EXACT []
 is_a: GO:0009987 ! cellular process
 is_a: GO:0040007 ! growth
 relationship: part_of GO : 0008361 ! regulation of cell size
