        <h3>Description</h3>

        <h5>GO as a Graph</h5>

<p>The Structure of GO can be described In terms Of a graph, where Each GO term Is a node, And the relationships between the terms are <br />
 edges between the nodes. GO Is loosely hierarchical, With 'child' terms being more specialized than their 'parent' terms, but unlike <br />
 a strict hierarchy, a term may have more than one parent term (note that the parent/child model does not hold true for all types of <br />
 relation)</p>

<p>(功能定义,term相当于一个节点，节点之间的继承关系是非严格的，即某一个子节点可能会有多个父节点)</p>

<h4>Sample GO Term</h4>

<p>The following Is a GO term taken from the OBO format file.</p>

<p></p>

<pre><code class="">id: GO : 0016049

def: "The process in which a cell irreversibly increases in size over time by accretion and biosynthetic production of matter similar to that already present." [GOC:ai]
subset: goslim_generic
subset: goslim_plant
subset: gosubset_prok
synonym: "cell expansion" RELATED []
synonym: "cellular growth" EXACT []
