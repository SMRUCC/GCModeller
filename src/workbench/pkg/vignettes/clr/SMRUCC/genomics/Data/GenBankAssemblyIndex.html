 ASSEMBLY SUMMARY FILES
 ======================
 
 The assembly_summary files report metadata for the genome assemblies on the 
 NCBI genomes FTP site.
 
 Four master files reporting data for either GenBank or RefSeq genome assemblies 
 are available under;;;auto<em>url+3xxx;;; assembly</em>summary_genbank.txt            - current GenBank genome assemblies
 assembly<em>summary</em>genbank_historical.txt - replaced and suppressed GenBank genome
                                           assemblies
 assembly<em>summary</em>refseq.txt             - current RefSeq genome assemblies
 assembly<em>summary</em>refseq_historical.txt  - replaced and suppressed RefSeq genome
                                           assemblies
 
 assembly<em>summary</em>genbank.txt and assembly<em>summary</em>genbank_historical.txt are 
 also available at:
;;;auto<em>url+4xxx;;;;;;auto</em>url+5xxx;;; 
 
 assembly<em>summary</em>refseq.txt and assembly<em>summary</em>refseq_historical.txt are 
 also available at:
;;;auto<em>url+6xxx;;;;;;auto</em>url+7xxx;;; 
 The assembly_summary.txt files in the directories named for taxonomic groups or
 species contain the relevant subsets of the data from the master files.
 
 =====================================
 HOW TO USE THE ASSEMBLY SUMMARY FILES
 =====================================
 
 The metadata provided in the assembly_summary.txt files can be used to identify
 assemblies of interest for subsequent download. 
 
 The Genomes FTP FAQ provides examples of how to use the assembly_summary.txt 
 files to download sets of assemblies. See: 
 
 How can I download only the current version of each assembly?

 How can I download RefSeq data for all complete bacterial genomes?
