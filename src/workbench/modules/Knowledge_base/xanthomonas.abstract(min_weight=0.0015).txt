The genus Xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of bacterial phytopath <null Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism revealed that strains of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv Abstract Bacteria belonging to the genus Xanthomonas are important pathogens of many plants, and their virulence appears to be due primarily to secreted and surface compounds that could increase host nutrient loss, or avoid or suppress unfavorable conditions in the host albilineans and is thus a biological alternative for the control of leaf scald disease in sugarcane Thus, compared with the other markers tested, cpn60 proved to be a powerful DNA barcode, providing a reliable and effective means for the species- and pathovar-level identification of the quarantine plant pathogen Xanthomonas Interestingly, infection by XacF1 phage caused several physiological changes to the bacterial host cells, including lower levels of extracellular polysaccharide production, reduced motility, slower growth rate, and a dramatic reduction in virulence Our results suggest that this hemagglutinin-like protein is required for tissue colonization being mainly involved in surface attachment and biofilm formation, and that plant tissue attachment and cell-to-cell aggregation are dependent on the coordinated action of adhesin molecules and exopolysaccharides In the past, the taxonomy of bacteria has been dominated by a phenetic approach, and many classification systems have been and still are based on what were thought to be important phenotypic properties citri potentially associated with pathogenicity and virulence were used to compare the transcriptional alterations of this bacterium in response to two synthetic media #R##N##R##N#Nonexpressor of PR1 (NPR1) represents an essential component of SA signaling that acts as a transcriptional coactivator to induce transcriptional reprogramming, including the induction of PR (for pathogenesis-related) genes and genes associated with secretion (Wang et al , 2012), and particular proteasomal subunits have been proposed to act as a caspase-like enzyme during the induction of programmed cell death in response to avirulent bacterial strains (Hatsugai et al Certain strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae secrete syringolin A (SylA), which is a small nonribosomal peptide that inhibits proteasome activity through binding to the catalytic subunits of the 20S CP and is required for full virulence on host plants, such as bean (Phaseolus vulgaris The initial discovery of the interaction between the bacterial T3E protein Xanthomonas outer protein J (XopJ) from Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria (Xcv) and Regulatory Particle AAA-ATPase6 (RPT6), a subunit of the 19S RP, provided, to our knowledge, the first example of a bacterial T3E directly targeting the proteasome (Ustun et al Here, we show that XopJ acts as a protease to directly degrade its target protein, RPT6, in a process that is dependent on the localization of XopJ at the plasma membrane and on an intact catalytic triad of the effector Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , which is non-phytopathogenic and taxonomically closely related to Xanthomonas , has undergone several classifications from Pseudomonas to Xanthomonas and finally to Stenotrophomonas In this study, we have investigated the phylogenetic and taxonomic status of these members using the complete RNA polymerase beta-subunit ( rpoB ) gene sequences available from their sequenced genomes Not only did we obtain a phylogenetic tree for xanthomonads, but rpoB gene sequence information has also resolved the taxonomic relationship of X albilineans and other Xanthomonas strains, with the most marked evidence being that Stenotrophomonas is synonymous to Xanthomonas This study has revealed the power and potential of complete rpoB gene sequence in taxonomic, phylogenetic and evolutionary studies on Xanthomonas and Stenotrophomonas generic complex Abstract The phytopathogenic genus Xanthomonas comprises numerous species and pathovars described primarily on their host and tissue specificities In rice, one of the best characterized PRRs is XA21, a leucine rich repeat receptor-like kinase that confers broad-spectrum resistance to multiple strains of the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv A cluster dendrogram based on the combined data of RAPD and ISSR showed that genetic diversity exists in local isolates of Xanthomonas In this study, we demonstrated that the transcription of xpsE, a homologue of gspE in Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris (Xcc), is upregulated by Clp, a homologue of the cyclic AMP-receptor protein, by directly binding to the xpsE promoter region oryzae mutants also overproduce one or more siderophores and exhibit a growth deficiency under low iron conditions as well as in the presence of reducing agents that are expected to promote the conversion of Fe +3 to Fe +2 oryzae and that an inability to cope with the conditions of low iron availability in the host may be the reason for the virulence deficiency of the rpfF X In total, 83 Xanthomonas -like strains were isolated from seed samples and leaves of cabbage and tronchuda cole with typical symptoms of the disease It has been proposed that these proteins participate in a signal transduction system linking changes in the environment to the synthesis of DSF and the expression of virulence genes The genetic diversity and the type III effector repertoires of a large sampling of field strains for this disease have yet to be explored on a genomic scale, limiting our understanding of pathogen evolution in an agricultural setting PCR screening of a collection of 94 plant pathogenic bacteria indicates that these novel NRPS gene clusters are specific to the genus Xanthomonas and are also present in Xanthomonas translucens and X Microscopy analyses were performed to compare patterns of bacterial migration in the wild-type and knockout strains and we observed that the formation of mushroom-like structures in X As causal agents of bacterial wilt in pastures and meadows, bacteria of the species Xanthomonas translucens are a serious issue in forage grass production In contrast with the T3SS-dependent defence suppression that has been observed for some other plant pathogenic bacteria, the Xcc B186 and B305 wild-type strains (which are virulent on Arabidopsis) caused greater elicitation of host PR-1 and PR-5 expression and callose deposition in comparison with their respective T3SS mutants In summary, the T3SS components or effector suite from virulent Xcc strains elicit some host defence responses, but suppress other defences and stimulate more severe disease symptoms, AvrPto-disruptable elements other than FLS2 apparently contribute to the host restriction of Xcc, and in some virulent Xcc strains the T3SS is not absolutely required for wild-type levels of bacterial growth within the plant The nature of xa25-encoding protein and its expression pattern in comparison with its susceptible allele in rice‐Xoo interaction indicate that the mechanism of xa25-mediated resistance appears to be different from that conferred by most of the characterized R proteins On the basis of these findings, infested seeds must be seen as a major source of inoculum for this disease in the region <null Abstract The extracellular polysaccharides from a number of Xanthomonas strains, together with preparations from strains grown under different conditions, have been examined by conventional biochemical methods N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), the main component of chitin and a major constituent of bacterial peptidoglycan, is present only in trace amounts in plants, in contrast to the huge amount of various sugars that compose the polysaccharides of the plant cell wall Our results extend the range of sources of GlcNAc metabolized by this phytopathogenic bacterium during its life cycle to include chitooligosaccharides that could originate from fungi or in- sects present in the plant environment, muropeptides leached during peptidoglycan recycling and bacterial lysis, and N-glycans from plantN-glycosylated proteins present in the plant cell wall as well as in xylem sap In a proof-of-principle experiment, RNA-seq was used to identify a candidate for Bs4C, an R gene from pepper that mediates recognition of the Xanthomonas TALE protein AvrBs4 The sensitivity of the primers in conventional PCR was 50 pg ll 1 for purified DNA and ranged from 5 9 10 2 to 5 9 10 4 CFU ml 1 when bacterial suspensions were analysed
