  <abstract>The phytopathogenic genus Xanthomonas comprises numerous species and pathovars described primarily on their host and tissue specificities. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , which is non-phytopathogenic and taxonomically closely related to Xanthomonas , has undergone several classifications from Pseudomonas to Xanthomonas and finally to Stenotrophomonas . In this study, we have investigated the phylogenetic and taxonomic status of these members using the complete RNA polymerase beta-subunit ( rpoB ) gene sequences available from their sequenced genomes. Not only did we obtain a phylogenetic tree for xanthomonads, but rpoB gene sequence information has also resolved the taxonomic relationship of X. axonopodis pathovars, X. albilineans and other Xanthomonas strains, with the most marked evidence being that Stenotrophomonas is synonymous to Xanthomonas . This study has revealed the power and potential of complete rpoB gene sequence in taxonomic, phylogenetic and evolutionary studies on Xanthomonas and Stenotrophomonas generic complex.
