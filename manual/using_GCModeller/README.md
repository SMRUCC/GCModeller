# Protocol for Build Virtual Cell Model Using GCModeller

For learn how to using the CLI system in GCModeller tools, please view this [help document](../../GCModeller/README.md).

 + Primary Annotation(molecular level)
 + Secondary Annotation(Individual cellular network annotation, module level)
 + S-system/FBA model Annotation(Integrated cellular network annotation, system level)

### 1. Basically annotation

##### a. Primary Annotation

> The primary annotation contains these three basically steps: 
> + **alignment**, perform by blastp bbh or sbh 
> + **catalog**, catalog the proteins into ortholog groups
> + **profiling**, quantities counting of the groups

   1. [COG](./orthology/COG.md): Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins
   2. [KO](./orthology/KO.md): KEGG Orthology
   3. [GO](./orthology/GO.md): Gene Onthology

##### b. Secondary Annotation
   1. Metabolism Pathway Network
   2. Protein Interaction Network
   3. Genomics Transcription Regulation Network
   4. Signals Network
   5. Transmembrane Pathway

### 2. Systems Biology Annotation

Follow these two steps to build ``SBML`` model file. 

##### 1. Build S-system model and FBA model
##### 2. Dynamics Parameters Estimates

### 3. Using GCModeller Engine
##### 1. Build GCModeller Virtual Cell Model
##### 2. Running the model test in GCModeller
