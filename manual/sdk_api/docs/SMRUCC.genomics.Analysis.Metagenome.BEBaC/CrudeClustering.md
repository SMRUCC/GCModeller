### Methods

#### InitializePartitions
```csharp
SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.Metagenome.BEBaC.CrudeClustering.InitializePartitions(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.Metagenome.BEBaC.I3merVector},System.Int32)
```
**Initialization**
 
 Cluster ``y(N)`` into ``Kmax`` clusters Using complete linkage algorithm

|Parameter Name|Remarks|
|--------------|-------|
|s|-|
|kmax|-|


#### StochasticSearch
```csharp
SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.Metagenome.BEBaC.CrudeClustering.StochasticSearch
```
Apply each of the four search operators described below
 to the the current partition S in a random order. Then, if
 the resulting partition leads To a higher marginal likelihood, 
 update the current partition S, otherwise keep
 the current partition. If all operators fail To update the
 current partition, then Stop And Set the best partition S'
 as the current partition S.
