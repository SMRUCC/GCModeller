# KMer
_namespace: [SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.CRISPR.CRT.SearchingModel](./index.md)_

An occurrence of a CRISPR. Repetitive sequences are detected by reading a small search window 
 and then scanning ahead for exact k-mer matches separated by a similar distance.

> 	Using in silico analysis we studied a novel family of repetitive DNA sequences that is present among both domains of the prokaryotes (Archaea and Bacteria), but absent from eukaryotes or viruses. This family is characterized by direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by similarly sized nonrepetitive sequences. To appreciate their characteristic structure, we will refer to this family as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). In most species with two or more CRISPR loci, these loci were flanked on one side by a common leader sequence of 300-500 b. The direct repeats and the leader sequences were conserved within a species, but dissimilar between species. The presence of multiple chromosomal CRISPR loci suggests that CRISPRs are mobile elements. Four CRISPR-associated (cas) genes were identified in CRISPR-containing prokaryotes that were absent from CRISPR-negative prokaryotes. The cas genes were invariably located adjacent to a CRISPR locus, indicating that the cas genes and CRISPR loci have a functional relationship. The cas3 gene showed motifs characteristic for helicases of the superfamily 2, and the cas4 gene showed motifs of the RecB family of exonucleases, suggesting that these genes are involved in DNA metabolism or gene expression. The spatial coherence of CRISPR and cas genes may stimulate new research on the genesis and biological role of these repeats and genes.

### Methods

#### __sequenceScan
```csharp
SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.CRISPR.CRT.SearchingModel.KMer.__sequenceScan(SMRUCC.genomics.SequenceModel.NucleotideModels.NucleicAcid,System.Int32,SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.CRISPR.CRT.SearchingModel.CRISPR,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Double)
```
scan to the right and left of the first and last repeat to see if there is a region
that is similar to the repeats. necessary in case we missed a repeat because of
inexact matches or a result of one of the filters

#### GetActualRepeatLength
```csharp
SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.CRISPR.CRT.SearchingModel.KMer.GetActualRepeatLength(SMRUCC.genomics.SequenceModel.NucleotideModels.NucleicAcid,SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.CRISPR.CRT.SearchingModel.CRISPR,SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.CRISPR.CRT.SearchingModel.KmerProfile,System.Double)
```
identified repeats may represent only a subset of a larger repeat. this method extends these
 repeats as long as they continue to match within some range. assumes there are at least two repeats

```csharp
SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.CRISPR.CRT.SearchingModel.KMer.HasNonRepeatingSpacers(SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.CRISPR.CRT.SearchingModel.CRISPR,System.Double)
```
Checks first five spacers
