|Type|Summary|
|----|-------|
|[Correlation](./Correlation.md)|for n > 1 motifs there should be (n * (n - 1)) / 2 correlations, obviously there are none for only 1 motif|
|[DbProperty](./DbProperty.md)|the database tags are expected to be ordered in file specification order|
|[HitResult](./HitResult.md)|gap, while superfluous, makes creating motif diagrams for the text version much easier when using XSLT|
|[MAST](./MAST.md)|mast.xml|
|[Motif](./Motif.md)||
|[MotifSite](./MotifSite.md)||
|[Score](./Score.md)||
|[Segment](./Segment.md)|within each seg the hit tags are expected to be ordered by pos ascending and then forward strand first|
|[SequenceDescript](./SequenceDescript.md)|the sequence tags are expected to be ordered by best combined p-value (of contained score tags) ascending|
|[SequenceList](./SequenceList.md)||
