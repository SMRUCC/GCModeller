# FeatureQualifiers
_namespace: [SMRUCC.genomics.Assembly.NCBI.GenBank.GBFF.Keywords.FEATURES](./index.md)_

Qualifiers provide additional information about features. They take
 the form of a slash (/) followed by a qualifier name and, if
 applicable, an equal sign (=) and a qualifier value. Feature
 qualifiers begin at column 22
