Frames within the Reactions class describe properties of a biochemical reaction independent
 of any enzyme or enzymes that catalyze that reaction. A reaction is a biochemical
 transformation that interconverts two sets of chemical compounds (which includes small
 metabolites, proteins, and DNA regions), and may translocate compounds from one cellular
 compartment to another. Most reactions are written in a conventional direction that
 has been assigned by the Enzyme Nomenclature Commission, but that direction may or
 may not be the predominate physiological direction of the reaction. Reaction substrates
 can include small-molecular-weight compounds (for metabolic reactions), proteins (such
 as in signaling pathways), and DNA sites (such as for reactions involving binding of transcription
 factors to DNA).
