|Type|Summary|
|----|-------|
|[ControlFlow](./ControlFlow.md)|These are the basic control-flow constructs of the R language. They function in much the same way as control statements in any Algol-like language.  ...|
|[expandGrid](./expandGrid.md)|Create a data frame from all combinations of the supplied vectors or factors. See the description of the return value for precise details of the way this is done. ...|
|[options](./options.md)|Allow the user to set and examine a variety of global options which affect the way in which R computes and displays its results. ...|
|[save](./save.md)|save writes an external representation of R objects to the specified file. The objects can be read back from the file at a later date by using the function load or attach (or data in some cases).|
|[saveImage](./saveImage.md)|save.image() is just a short-cut for ‘save my current workspace’, i.e., save(list = ls(all.names = TRUE), file = ".RData", envir = .GlobalEnv). It is also what happens with q("yes").|
