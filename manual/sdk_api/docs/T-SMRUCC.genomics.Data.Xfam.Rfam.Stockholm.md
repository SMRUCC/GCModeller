Rfam.seed
 
 Stockholm format is a Multiple sequence alignment format used by Pfam and Rfam to disseminate protein and RNA sequence alignments. 
 The alignment editors Ralee and Belvu support Stockholm format as do the probabilistic database search tools, 
 Infernal and HMMER, and the phylogenetic analysis tool Xrate.
