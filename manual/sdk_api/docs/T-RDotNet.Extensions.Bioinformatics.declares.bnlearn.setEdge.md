_namespace: [RDotNet.Extensions.Bioinformatics.declares.bnlearn](N-RDotNet.Extensions.Bioinformatics.declares.bnlearn.html)_

The set.edge function operates in the following way:

 If there Is no arc between from And To, the undirected arc from - To Is added.
 If there Is an undirected arc between from And To, no action Is taken.
 If either the arc from -> To Or the arc To -> from are present, they are replaced With the undirected arc from - To.
