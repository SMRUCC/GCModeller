Experiment
 While working with article, annotator adds experiments to database. Annotation of each experiment includes list of experimental techniques used in the experiment, list of regulatory elements studied in the experiment and description of the experiment (recently, we included additional field describing the aim of the experiment). 

 Types of experimental techniques are stored in ExpTypes table. 
 Links to regulatory elements studied in the experiment are stored in ExpSubObject table.
