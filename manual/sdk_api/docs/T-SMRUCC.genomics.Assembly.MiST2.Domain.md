The Microbial Signal Transduction database contains the signal transduction proteins 
 for bacterial and archaeal genomes (2,457 complete and 5,181 draft). These are 
 identified using various domain profiles that directly or indirectly implicate a 
 particular protein in participating in signal transduction.
