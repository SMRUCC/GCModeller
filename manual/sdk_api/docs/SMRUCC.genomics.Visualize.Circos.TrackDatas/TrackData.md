# TrackData
_namespace: [SMRUCC.genomics.Visualize.Circos.TrackDatas](./index.md)_

Data for tracks is loaded from a plain-text file. Each data point is stored on a 
 separate line, except for links which use two lines per link.
 
 The definition Of a data point within a track Is based On the genomic range, 
 which Is a combination Of chromosome And start/End position.

>  All data values, regardless Of track type, will be positioned Using a range rather than a Single position. To explicitly specify a Single position,

>  # value for text tracks Is interpreted as text

>  + Finally, links are a special track type which associates two ranges together. The format For links Is analogous To other data types, 
>  except now two coordinates are specified.

>  + In addition to the chromosome, range And (if applicable) value, each data point can be annotated with formatting parameters that control how the point Is drawn. 
>  The parameters need to be compatible with the track type for which the file Is destined. Thus, a scatter plot data point might have

>  chr12 1000 5000 0.25 glyph_size=10p,glyph=circle

>  chr12 1000 5000 0.25 fill_color=orange
