### Methods

#### Frame
```csharp
SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.PFSNet.R.Graph.Data.Frame(SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.PFSNet.DataStructure.GraphEdge[],System.Boolean,Microsoft.VisualBasic.Data.csv.DocumentStream.DataFrame)
```
This function creates an igraph graph from one or two data frames containing the (symbolic) edge list and edge/vertex attributes.

|Parameter Name|Remarks|
|--------------|-------|
|d|A data frame containing a symbolic edge list in the first two columns. Additional columns are considered as edge attributes.|
|vertices|
 If vertices is NULL, then the first two columns of d are used as a symbolic edge list and additional columns as edge attributes. The names of the attributes are taken from the names of the columns.
 If vertices is not NULL, then it must be a data frame giving vertex metadata. The first column of vertices is assumed to contain symbolic vertex names, this will be added to the graphs as the ‘name’ vertex attribute. Other columns will be added as additional vertex attributes. If vertices is not NULL then the symbolic edge list given in d is checked to contain only vertex names listed in vertices.
 Typically, the data frames are exported from some speadsheat software like Excel and are imported into R via read.table, read.delim or read.csv.

#### simplify
```csharp
SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.PFSNet.R.Graph.Data.simplify(SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.PFSNet.DataStructure.PFSNetGraph)
```
simplify(graph, remove.multiple = TRUE, remove.loops = TRUE,
 edge.attr.comb = getIgraphOpt("edge.attr.comb"))
 is.simple(graph)
 
 Simple graphs are graphs which do not contain loop and multiple edges.
 
 A loop edge is an edge for which the two endpoints are the same vertex. Two edges are multiple edges if they have exactly the same two endpoints (for directed graphs order does matter). A graph is simple is it does not contain loop edges and multiple edges.
 
 is.simple checks whether a graph is simple.
 
 simplify removes the loop and/or multiple edges from a graph. If both remove.loops and remove.multiple are TRUE the function returns a simple graph.

|Parameter Name|Remarks|
|--------------|-------|
|graph|-|


_returns: A new graph object with the edges deleted._
