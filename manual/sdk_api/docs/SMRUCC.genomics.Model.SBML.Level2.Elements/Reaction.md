A reaction represents any transformation, transport or binding process, typically a chemical reaction, 
 that can change the quantity of one or more species. In SBML, a reaction is defined primarily in terms 
 of the participating reactants and products (and their corresponding stoichiometries), along with 
 optional modifier species, an optional rate at which the reaction takes place, and optional parameters.
