Definition: Imposes ordering on a step in a biochemical pathway. 
 
 Retionale: A biochemical reaction can be reversible by itself, 
 but can be physiologically directed In the context Of a pathway, 
 For instance due To flux Of reactants And products. 
 
 Usage: Only one conversion interaction can be ordered at a time,
