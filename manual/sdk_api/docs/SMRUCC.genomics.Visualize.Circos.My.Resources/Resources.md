_namespace: [SMRUCC.genomics.Visualize.Circos.My.Resources](./index.md)_

A strongly-typed resource class, for looking up localized strings, etc.




### Properties

#### colors
Looks up a localized string similar to # RGB color definition. Colors are refered to within configuration files
# by their name. In order to use a color, you must define it here. 
#
# Common colors (red, green, blue, etc) are already defined in 7
# tones, based on 7 color Brewer palettes, where available.
#
# vvlHUE (very very light HUE, e.g. vvlred)
# vlHUE (very light HUE, e.g. vlred)
# lHUE (light HUE, e.g. red)
# HUE (e.g. red)
# dHUE (dark HUE, e.g. dred)
# vdHUE (very dark HUE, e.g. vdred))

#### colors_brewer
Looks up a localized string similar to # Colors from www.ColorBrewer.org by Cynthia A. Brewer, Geography, Pennsylvania State University.
# See www.colorbrewer.org for details.
#
# Color names are formatted as PALETTE-NUMCOLORS-TYPE-COLORCODE
#
# where PALETTE is the palette name, NUMCOLORS is the number of colors in the palette, TYPE is the palette type (div, seq, qual) and COLORCODE is the color index within the palette (another versison of the color is defined where COLORCODE is the color's letter, unique to a combination of PALETTE and T [rest of string was truncated]";.
