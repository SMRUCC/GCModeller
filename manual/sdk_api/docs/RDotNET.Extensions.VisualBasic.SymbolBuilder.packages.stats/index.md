|Type|Summary|
|----|-------|
|[AsDist](./AsDist.md)||
|[dist](./dist.md)|This function computes and returns the distance matrix computed by using the specified distance measure to compute the distances between the rows of a data matrix.|
|[distAPI](./distAPI.md)|Distance Matrix Computation|
|[heatmap](./heatmap.md)|A heat map is a false color image (basically image(t(x))) with a dendrogram added to the left side and to the top. Typically, reordering of the rows and columns according to some set of values (row or column means) within the restrictions imposed by the dendrogram is carried out.|
|[heatmap_plot](./heatmap_plot.md)||
|[kmeans](./kmeans.md)|Perform k-means clustering on a data matrix.|
|[print](./print.md)|## S3 method for class 'dist'|
|[ts](./ts.md)||
