# Links
_namespace: [SMRUCC.genomics.Visualize.Circos.Configurations.Nodes.Plots](./index.md)_

Links are defined in ``<link>`` blocks enclosed in a ``<links>`` block. 
 The links start at a radial position defined by 'radius' and have their
 control point (adjusts curvature) at the radial position defined by
 'bezier_radius'. In this example, I use the segmental duplication
 data Set, which connects regions Of similar sequence (90%+
 similarity, at least 1kb In size).
