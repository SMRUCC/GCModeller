Like with other tracks, text is limited to a radial range by setting
 ``r0`` And ``r1``.

 Individual labels can be repositioned automatically With In a
 position window To fit more labels, without overlap. This Is an
 advanced feature - see the 2D Track text tutorials.

Short lines can be placed before the label to connect them to the

 rearranged.
