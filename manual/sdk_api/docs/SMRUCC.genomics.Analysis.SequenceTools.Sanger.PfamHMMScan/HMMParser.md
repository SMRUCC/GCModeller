### Properties

#### ACC
Accession number; <s> is a one-word accession number. This is picked up from the #=GF AC
 line in a Stockholm format alignment. Optional.
#### ALPH
Symbol alphabet type. For biosequence analysis models, <s> is amino, DNA, or RNA (case insensitive).
 There are also other accepted alphabets For purposes beyond biosequence analysis,
 including coins, dice, and custom. This determines the symbol alphabet And the size Of the symbol
 emission probability distributions. If amino, the alphabet size K Is Set To 20 And the symbol
 alphabet to “ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY” (alphabetic order); if DNA, the alphabet size K Is set
 to 4 And the symbol alphabet to “ACGT”; if RNA, the alphabet size K Is set to 4 And the symbol
 alphabet to “ACGU”. Mandatory.
#### CKSUM
Training alignment checksum; <d> is a nonnegative unsigned 32-bit integer. This number is
 calculated from the training sequence data, And used In conjunction With the alignment map information
 to verify that a given alignment Is indeed the alignment that the map Is for. Optional.
#### COM
Command line log; <n> counts command line numbers, and <s> is a one-line command.
 There may be more than one COM line per save file, Each numbered starting from n = 1. These
 lines record every HMMER command that modified the save file. This helps us reproducibly And
 automatically log how Pfam models have been constructed, For example. Optional.
#### CONS
Consensus residue annotation flag; <s> is either no or yes (case insensitive). If yes, the consensus
 residue field For Each match state In the main model (see below) Is valid. If no, these characters
 are ignored. Consensus residue annotation Is determined When models are built. For models Of
 Single sequences, the consensus Is the same As the query sequence. For models Of multiple alignments,
 the consensus Is the maximum likelihood residue at Each position. Upper Case indicates
 that the model's emission probability for the consensus residue is an arbitrary threshold (0.5 for
 protein models, 0.9 for DNA/RNA models).
#### CS
Consensus structure annotation flag; <s> is either no or yes (case insensitive). If yes, the consensus
 Structure character field For Each match state In the main model (see below) Is valid; If no
 these characters are ignored. Consensus Structure annotation Is picked up from a Stockholm file's
 #=GC SS_cons line, And propagated to alignment displays. Optional; assumed to be no if Not
 present.
#### DATE
Date the model was constructed; <s> is a free text date string. This field is only used for logging
 purposes.y Optional.
#### DESC
Description line; <s> is a one-line free text description. This is picked up from the #=GF DE line
 in a Stockholm alignment file. Optional.
#### EFFN
Effective sequence number; <f> is a nonzero positive real, the effective total number of sequences
 determined by hmmbuild during sequence weighting, For combining observed counts With
 Dirichlet prior information In parameterizing the model. This field Is only used For logging purposes.
 Optional.
#### GA
Pfam gathering thresholds GA1 and GA2. See Pfam documentation of GA lines. Optional.
#### HMM
The first line in the main model section may be an optional line starting with COMPO: these are
 the model's overall average match state emission probabilities, which are used as a background
 residue composition In the “filter null” model. The K fields On this line are log probabilities For Each
 residue in the appropriate biosequence alphabet's order. Optional.
#### LENG
Model length; <d>, a positive nonzero integer, is the number of match states in the model.
 Mandatory.
#### MAP
Map annotation flag; <s> is either no or yes (case insensitive). If set to yes, the map annotation
 field in the main model (see below) Is valid; if no, that field will be ignored. The HMM/alignment map
 annotates each match state with the index of the alignment column from which it came. It can be
 used for quickly mapping any subsequent HMM alignment back to the original multiple alignment,
 via the model. Optional; assumed To be no If Not present.
#### MAXL
Max instance length; <d>, a positive nonzero integer, is the upper bound on the length at which
 And instance of the model Is expected to be found. Used only by nhmmer And nhmmscan. Optional.
#### MM
Model masked flag; <s> is either no or yes (case insensitive). If yes, the model mask annotation
 character field For Each match state In the main model (see below) Is valid; If no, these characters
 are ignored. Indicates that the profile model was created such that emission probabilities at masked
 positions are Set To match the background frequency, rather than being Set based On observed
 frequencies in the alignment. Position-specific insertion And deletion rates are Not altered, even in
 masked regions. Optional; assumed To be no If Not present.
#### NAME
Model name; <s> is a single word containing no spaces or tabs. The name is normally picked up
 from the #=GF ID line from a Stockholm alignment file. If this Is Not present, the name Is created
 from the name Of the alignment file by removing any file type suffix. For example, an otherwise
 nameless HMM built from the alignment file rrm.slx would be named rrm. Mandatory.
#### NC
Pfam noise cutoffs NC1 and NC2. See Pfam documentation of NC lines. Optional.
#### NSEQ
Sequence number; <d> is a nonzero positive integer, the number of sequences that the HMM
 was trained On. This field Is only used For logging purposes. Optional.
#### RF
Reference annotation flag; <s> is either no or yes (case insensitive). If yes, the reference annotation
 character field For Each match state In the main model (see below) Is valid; If no, these
 characters are ignored. Reference column annotation Is picked up from a Stockholm alignment
 file's #=GC RF line. It is propagated to alignment outputs, and also may optionally be used to define
 consensus match columns In profile HMM construction. Optional; assumed To be no If Not
 present.
#### STATS
Statistical parameters needed for E-value calculations. <s1> is the model’s
 alignment mode configuration: currently only LOCAL Is recognized. <s2> Is the name Of the score
 distribution: currently MSV, VITERBI, and FORWARD are recognized. <f1> And <f2> are two realvalued
 parameters controlling location And slope Of Each distribution, respectively; And For
 Gumbel distributions For MSV And Viterbi scores, And And For exponential tails For Forward
 scores. values must be positive. All three lines Or none of them must be present: when all three
 are present, the model Is considered To be calibrated For E-value statistics. Optional.
#### TC
Pfam trusted cutoffs TC1 and TC2. See Pfam documentation of TC lines. Optional.
