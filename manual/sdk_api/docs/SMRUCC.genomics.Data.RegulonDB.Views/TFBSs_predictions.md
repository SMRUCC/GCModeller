 # Title: Computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) using the evaluated weight matrix v3.0
 #
 #
 # Description Of the dataset:
 #
 # Computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) In
 # upstream regions Of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome, based On version 8.8
 # Of RegulonDB.
 # We scanned all upstream regions Of every Single gene, from +50 To -400 Or
 # from +50 To the closest upstream ORF, whatever happens first.
 #
