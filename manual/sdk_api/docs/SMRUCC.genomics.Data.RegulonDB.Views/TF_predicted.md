 # 
 # Transcription Factor Prediction Dataset Version 2.0
 #
 # 184 TFs experimentally characterized And deposited In RegulonDB were used As 
 # seeds In BLASTP searches against the complete proteome Of E. coli. E-values ≤ 1E-6 
 # And a coverage Of 70% were considered. In addition, TFs specifically associated To 
 # E. coli K12 And deposited In DBD database, HAMAP, Superfamily DB And PFAM 
 # databases were retrieved.
 #
 # Reference:
 #
 # The functional landscape bound To the transcription factors Of Escherichia coli K-12.
