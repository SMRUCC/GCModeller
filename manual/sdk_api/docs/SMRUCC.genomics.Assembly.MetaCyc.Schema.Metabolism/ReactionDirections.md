# ReactionDirections
_namespace: [SMRUCC.genomics.Assembly.MetaCyc.Schema.Metabolism](./index.md)_

This slot specifies the directionality of a reaction. This slot is used in slightly different 
 ways in class Reactions and Enzymatic-Reactions. In class Enzymatic-Reactions, the slot specifies 
 information about the direction of the reaction associated with the enzymatic-reaction, by the 
 associated enzyme. That is, the directionality information refers only to the case in which the 
 reaction is catalyzed by that enzyme, and may be influenced by the regulation of that enzyme.
 
 The slot is particularly important to fill for reactions that are not part of a pathway, because 
 for such reactions, the direction cannot be determined automatically, whereas for reactions 
 within a pathway, the direction can be inferred from the pathway context. This slot aids the 
 user and software in inferring the direction in which the reaction typically occurs in 
 physiological settings, relative to the direction in which the reaction is stored in the database.




### Properties

#### IrreversibleLeftToRight
For all practical purposes, the reaction occurs only in the specified direction in 
 physiological settings, because of chemical properties of the reaction.
#### IrreversibleRightToLeft
For all practical purposes, the reaction occurs only in the specified direction in 
 physiological settings, because of chemical properties of the reaction.
#### LeftToRight
The reaction occurs in the specified direction in physiological settings, but it is unknown 
 whether the reaction is considered irreversible.
#### PhysiolLeftToRight
The reaction occurs in the specified direction in physiological settings, because of several 
 possible factors including the energetics of the reaction, local concentrations of reactants 
 and products, and the regulation of the enzyme or its expression.
#### PhysiolRightToLeft
The reaction occurs in the specified direction in physiological settings, because of several 
 possible factors including the energetics of the reaction, local concentrations of reactants 
 and products, and the regulation of the enzyme or its expression.
#### Reversible
The reaction occurs in both directions in physiological settings.
#### RightToLeft
The reaction occurs in the specified direction in physiological settings, but it is unknown 
 whether the reaction is considered irreversible.
