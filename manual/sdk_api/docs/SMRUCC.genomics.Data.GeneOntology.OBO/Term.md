##### GO as a Graph
 
 The Structure of GO can be described In terms Of a graph, where Each GO term Is a node, And the relationships between the terms are 
 edges between the nodes. GO Is loosely hierarchical, With 'child' terms being more specialized than their 'parent' terms, but unlike 
 a strict hierarchy, a term may have more than one parent term (note that the parent/child model does not hold true for all types of 
 relation)
 
 (功能定义,term相当于一个节点，节点之间的继承关系是非严格的，即某一个子节点可能会有多个父节点)

### Properties

#### def
A textual description of what the term represents, plus reference(s) to the source of the information. 
 All new terms added to the ontology must have a definition; there remains a very small set of terms 
 from the original ontology that lack definitions, but the vast majority of terms are defined.
#### relationship
One or more links that capture how the term relates to other terms in the ontology. All terms 
 (other than the root terms representing each namespace, above) have an is a sub-class relationship 
 to another term; for example, GO:0015758 : glucose transport is a GO:0015749 : monosaccharide transport. 
 The Gene Ontology employs a number of other relations, including part of (e.g. GO:0031966 : 
 mitochondrial membrane part of GO:0005740 : mitochondrial envelope) and regulates (e.g. GO:0006916 : 
 anti-apoptosis regulates GO:0012501 : programmed cell death). The relations documentation has more 
 information on the relations used in the ontology.
#### subset
Indicates that the term belongs to a designated subset of terms, e.g. one of the GO slims.
#### synonym
Alternative words or phrases closely related in meaning to the term name, with indication of the relationship between the name 
 and synonym given by the synonym scope. The scopes for GO synonyms are:
 + exact
 an exact equivalent; interchangeable With the term name
 e.g. ornithine cycle Is an exact synonym of urea cycle
 + broad
 the synonym Is broader than the term name
 e.g. cell division Is a broad synonym of cytokinesis
 + narrow
 the synonym Is narrower Or more precise than the term name
 e.g. pyrimidine-dimer repair by photolyase Is a narrow synonym of photoreactive repair
 + related
 the terms are related In some way Not covered above
 e.g. cytochrome bc1 complex Is a related synonym of ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase activity virulence Is a related synonym of pathogenesis
 
 Custom synonym types are also used In the ontology. For example, a number Of synonyms are designated As systematic synonyms; 
 synonyms Of this type are exact synonyms Of the term name.
#### xref
Database cross-references, or dbxrefs, refer to identical or very similar objects in other databases. For instance, 
 the molecular function term retinal isomerase activity is cross-referenced with the Enzyme Commission 
 entry EC:5.2.1.3; the biological process term sulfate assimilation has the cross-reference MetaCyc:PWY-781.
