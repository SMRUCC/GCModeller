	MOTIVATION: Before performing a polymerase chain reaction experiment, a pair of primers to clip 
 the target DNA subsequence is required. However, this is a tedious task as too many constraints 
 need to be satisfied. Various kinds of approaches for designing a primer have been proposed in 
 the last few decades, but most of them do not have restriction sites on the designed primers and 
 do not satisfy the specificity constraint. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm imitates nature's 
 process of evolution and genetic operations on chromosomes in order to achieve optimal solutions, 
 and is a best fit for DNA behavior. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can 
 find a pair of primers that not only obeys the design properties but also has a specific 
 restriction site and specificity. Gel electrophoresis verifies that the proposed method really 
 can clip out the target sequence. AVAILABILITY: A public version of the software is available on 
 request from the authors.

 <summary>
 A restriction enzyme or restriction endonuclease is a special type of biological macromolecule that functions as part of the "immune system" in bacteria.
 One special kind of restriction enzymes is the class of "homing endonucleases", these being present in all three domains of life,
 although their function seems to be very different from one domain to another.
 The classical restriction enzymes cut up, And hence render harmless, any unknown (non-cellular) DNA that enters a bacterial cell As a result Of a viral infection.
 They recognize a specific DNA sequence, usually Short (3 To 8 bp), And cut it, producing either blunt Or overhung ends, either at Or nearby the recognition site.
 Restriction enzymes are quite variable In the Short DNA sequences they recognize.
 An organism often has several different enzymes, Each specific To a distinct Short DNA sequence.[1]

<member name="P:SMRUCC.genomics.Analysis.PrimerDesigner.Restriction_enzyme.Enzyme.Isoschizomers">
 <summary>
 Isoschizomers are pairs of restriction enzymes specific to the same recognition sequence. For example, SphI (CGTAC/G) and BbuI (CGTAC/G) are isoschizomers of each other.
 The first enzyme discovered which recognizes a given sequence is known as the prototype; all subsequently identified enzymes that recognize that sequence are isoschizomers.
 Isoschizomers are isolated from different strains of bacteria and therefore may require different reaction conditions.
 An enzyme that recognizes the same sequence but cuts it differently Is a neoschizomer. Neoschizomers are a specific type (subset) Of isoschizomer.
 For example, SmaI (CCC/GGG) And XmaI (C/CCGGG) are neoschizomers Of Each other.
 An enzyme that recognizes a slightly different sequence, but produces the same ends Is an isocaudomer.
 In some cases, only one out of a pair of isoschizomers can recognize both the methylated as well as unmethylated forms of restriction sites.
 In contrast, the other restriction enzyme can recognize only the unmethylated form of the restriction site.
 This property of some isoschizomers allows identification of methylation state of the restriction site while isolating it from a bacterial strain.
 For example, the restriction enzymes HpaII And MspI are isoschizomers, as they both recognize the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' when it is unmethylated.
 But when the second C of the sequence is methylated, only MspI can recognize it while HpaII cannot.

 Recognition sequence

 The recognition sequence, sometimes also referred to as recognition site, of any DNA-binding protein motif that exhibits binding specificity, refers to the DNA sequence (or subset thereof), to which the domain is specific. Recognition sequences are palindromes .
 The transcription factor Sp1 For example, binds the sequences 5'-(G/T)GGGCGG(G/A)(G/A)(C/T)-3', where (G/T) indicates that the domain will bind a guanine or thymine at this position.
 The restriction endonuclease PstI recognizes, binds, And cleaves the sequence 5'-CTGCAG-3'.
 However, a recognition sequence refers to a different aspect from that of recognition site. A given recognition sequence can occur one Or more times, Or Not at all on a specific DNA fragment. A recognition site Is specified by the position of the site. For example, there are two PstI recognition site in the following DNA sequence fragment, start at base 9 And 31 respectively. A recognition sequence Is a specific sequence, usually very short (less than 10 bases). Depending on the degree of specificity of the protein, a DNA-binding protein can bind to more than one specific sequence. For PstI, which has a single sequence specificity, it Is 5'-CTGCAG-3'. It is always the same whether at the first recognition site or the second in the following example sequence. For Sp1, which has multiple (16) sequence specificity as shown above, the two recognition sites in the following example sequence fragment are at 18 and 32, and their respective recognition sequences are 5'-GGGGCGGAGC-3' and 5'-TGGGCGGAAC-3'.
