.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
List Objects
 
 \fBls\fR and \fBobjects\fR return a vector of character strings giving 
 the names of the objects in the specified environment. When invoked 
 with no argument at the top level prompt, ls shows what data sets 
 and functions a user has defined. When invoked with no argument inside 
 a function, ls returns the names of the function's local variables: 
 this is useful in conjunction with \fBbrowser\fR.
