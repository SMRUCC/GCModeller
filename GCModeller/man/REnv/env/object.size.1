.SH NAME
object.size \- Report the Space Allocated for an Object
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIobject.size(\fBx\fR as <generic> Object);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Report the Space Allocated for an Object
 
 Provides an estimate of the memory that is being used to store 
 an R# object.
 
 Exactly which parts of the memory allocation should be attributed 
 to which object is not clear-cut. This function merely provides 
 a rough indication: it should be reasonably accurate for atomic 
 vectors, but does not detect if elements of a list are shared, for 
 example. (Sharing amongst elements of a character vector is taken 
 into account, but not that between character vectors in a single 
 object.)

 The calculation Is Of the size Of the Object, And excludes the 
 space needed To store its name In the symbol table.

 Associated space(e.g., the environment of a function And what the 
 pointer in a EXTPTRSXP points to) Is Not included in the 
 calculation.

 Object sizes are larger On 64-bit builds than 32-bit ones, but will 
 very likely be the same On different platforms With the same word 
 length And pointer size.
