.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBtext\fB \fR\- 
 character vector, each element of which is to be split. Other inputs, 
 including a factor, will give an error.

.PP
.PP
\fBdelimiter\fB \fR\- 
 character vector (or object which can be coerced to such) containing 
 regular expression(s) (unless fixed = TRUE) to use for splitting. 
 If empty matches occur, in particular if split has length 0, x is 
 split into single characters. If split has length greater than 1, 
 it is re-cycled along x.

.PP
.PP
\fBfixed\fB \fR\- 
 logical. If TRUE match split exactly, otherwise use regular expressions. 
 Has priority over perl.
