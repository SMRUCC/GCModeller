.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIrownames(\fBobject\fR as <generic> Object, 
\fBnamelist\fR as <generic> Array = \fB<NULL>\fR, 
[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Row and Column Names
 
 Retrieve or set the row or column names of a matrix-like object.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB[object]\fB \fR\- a matrix-like R object, with at least two dimensions for colnames.
.PP
.PP
\fBnamelist\fB \fR\- a valid value for that component of \fBdimnames(x)\fR. 
 For a matrix or array this is either NULL or a character vector of non-zero 
 length equal to the appropriate dimension.

.SH DETAILS
.PP
The extractor functions try to do something sensible for any matrix-like object x. 
 If the object has dimnames the first component is used as the row names, and the 
 second component (if any) is used for the column names. For a data frame, rownames 
 and colnames eventually call row.names and names respectively, but the latter are 
 preferred.
 
 If do.NULL Is FALSE, a character vector (of length NROW(x) Or NCOL(x)) Is returned 
 in any case, prepending prefix to simple numbers, if there are no dimnames Or the 
 corresponding component of the dimnames Is NULL.
 
 The replacement methods For arrays/matrices coerce vector And factor values Of value 
 To character, but Do Not dispatch methods For As.character.
 
 For a data frame, value for rownames should be a character vector of non-duplicated 
 And non-missing names (this Is enforced), And for colnames a character vector of 
 (preferably) unique syntactically-valid names. In both cases, value will be coerced 
 by as.character, And setting colnames will convert the row names To character.
