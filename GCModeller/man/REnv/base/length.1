The default method for length currently returns a non-negative 
 integer of length 1, except for vectors of more than 2^31 - 1 
 elements, when it returns a double.

 For vectors(including lists) And factors the length Is the 
 number of elements. For an environment it Is the number of 
 objects in the environment, And NULL has length 0. For expressions 
 And pairlists (including language objects And dotlists) it Is the 
 length of the pairlist chain. All other objects (including 
 functions) have length one: note that For functions this differs 
 from S.

 The replacement form removes all the attributes Of x except its 
 names, which are adjusted (And If necessary extended by "").
