.SH DETAILS
.PP
A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and 
 the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or 
 the dot not followed by a number. Names such as ".2way" are 
 not valid, and neither are the reserved words.

 The definition Of a letter depends On the current locale, but 
 only ASCII digits are considered To be digits.

 The character "X" Is prepended If necessary. All invalid 
 characters are translated To ".". A missing value Is translated 
 To "NA". Names which match R keywords have a dot appended To 
 them. Duplicated values are altered by make.unique.
