.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Data Frames
 
 The function data.frame() creates data frames, tightly coupled collections 
 of variables which share many of the properties of matrices and of lists, 
 used as the fundamental data structure by most of R's modeling software.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBcolumns\fB \fR\- 
 these arguments are of either the form value or tag = value. Component names 
 are created based on the tag (if present) or the deparsed argument itself.

.SH VALUE
.PP
A data frame, a matrix-like structure whose columns may be of differing types 
 (numeric, logical, factor and character and so on).

 How the names Of the data frame are created Is complex, And the rest Of this 
 paragraph Is only the basic story. If the arguments are all named And simple 
 objects (Not lists, matrices Of data frames) Then the argument names give the 
 column names. For an unnamed simple argument, a deparsed version Of the 
 argument Is used As the name (With an enclosing I(...) removed). For a named 
 matrix/list/data frame argument With more than one named column, the names Of 
 the columns are the name Of the argument followed by a dot And the column name 
 inside the argument: If the argument Is unnamed, the argument's column names 
 are used. For a named or unnamed matrix/list/data frame argument that contains 
 a single column, the column name in the result is the column name in the 
 argument. 
 Finally, the names are adjusted to be unique and syntactically valid unless 
 \fBcheck.names = FALSE\fR.
