.SH NAME
var \- Correlation, Variance and Covariance (Matrices)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIvar(\fBx\fR as <generic> Object, 
\fBy\fR as <generic> Object = \fB<NULL>\fR, 
\fBna_rm\fR as boolean = FALSE, 
\fBuse\fR as <integer> varUseMethods = [everything]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Correlation, Variance and Covariance (Matrices)
 
 var, cov and cor compute the variance of x and the covariance or 
 correlation of x and y if these are vectors. If x and y are 
 matrices then the covariances (or correlations) between the columns 
 of x and the columns of y are computed.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBx\fB \fR\- a numeric vector, matrix or data frame.
.PP
.PP
\fBy\fB \fR\- 
 NULL (default) or a vector, matrix or data frame with compatible dimensions to x. 
 The default is equivalent to y = x (but more efficient).

.PP
.PP
\fBna_rm\fB \fR\- logical. Should missing values be removed?
.PP
.PP
\fBuse\fB \fR\- 
 an optional character string giving a method for computing covariances 
 in the presence of missing values. This must be (an abbreviation of) 
 one of the strings "everything", "all.obs", "complete.obs", "na.or.complete", 
 or "pairwise.complete.obs".
