.SH DETAILS
.PP
If the con is a character string, the function calls file to obtain a file connection
 which is opened for the duration of the function call.

 If the connection Is open it Is written from its current position. If it Is Not open, 
 it Is opened For the duration Of the Call In "wt" mode And Then closed again.

 Normally writeLines Is used With a text-mode connection, And the Default separator Is 
 converted To the normal separator For that platform (LF On Unix/Linux, CRLF On Windows). 
 For more control, open a binary connection And specify the precise value you want 
 written To the file In sep. For even more control, use writeChar On a binary connection.

 useBytes Is for expert use. Normally (when false) character strings with marked 
 encodings are converted to the current encoding before being passed to the connection 
 (which might do further re-encoding). useBytes = TRUE suppresses the re-encoding of 
 marked strings so they are passed byte-by-byte to the connection: this can be useful 
 When strings have already been re-encoded by e.g. iconv. (It Is invoked automatically 
 For strings With marked encoding "bytes".)
