.SH DETAILS
.PP
The length of the result is the maximum of the lengths of the three arguments; 
 values of shorter arguments are recycled.

 The names are very likely To be unique among calls To tempfile In an R session 
 And across simultaneous R sessions (unless tmpdir Is specified). The filenames 
 are guaranteed Not To be currently In use.

 The file name Is made by concatenating the path given by tmpdir, the pattern 
 String, a random String In hex And a suffix Of fileext.

 By Default, tmpdir will be the directory given by tempdir(). This will be a 
 subdirectory of the per-session temporary directory found by the following 
 rule when the R session Is started. The environment variables TMPDIR, TMP And TEMP 
 are checked in turn And the first found which points to a writable directory Is 
 used: If none succeeds the value Of R_USER (see Rconsole) Is used. If the path 
 To the directory contains a space In any Of the components, the path returned will 
 use the shortnames version Of the path. Note that setting any Of these environment 
 variables In the R session has no effect On tempdir(): the per-session temporary 
 directory Is created before the interpreter Is started.
