.SH NAME
file.copy \- \fBfile.copy\fR works in a similar way to \fBfile.append\fR but with the arguments
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIfile.copy(\fBfrom\fR as string, 
\fBto\fR as string, 
[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBfile.copy\fR works in a similar way to \fBfile.append\fR but with the arguments 
 in the natural order for copying. Copying to existing destination files is 
 skipped unless overwrite = TRUE. The to argument can specify a single existing 
 directory. If copy.mode = TRUE file read/write/execute permissions are copied 
 where possible, restricted by ‘umask’. (On Windows this applies only to files.
 ) Other security attributes such as ACLs are not copied. On a POSIX filesystem 
 the targets of symbolic links will be copied rather than the links themselves, 
 and hard links are copied separately. Using copy.date = TRUE may or may not 
 copy the timestamp exactly (for example, fractional seconds may be omitted), 
 but is more likely to do so as from R 3.4.0.
