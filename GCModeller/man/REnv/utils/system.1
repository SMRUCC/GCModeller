Invoke a System Command
 
 \fBsystem\fR invokes the OS command specified by \fBcommand\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBcommand\fB \fR\- the system command to be invoked, as a character string.
.PP

\fBintern\fB \fR\- a logical (not NA) which indicates whether to capture the 
 output of the command as an R character vector.

.PP
\fBshow_output_on_console\fB \fR\- 
 logical (Not NA), indicates whether to capture the output of the command And show 
 it on the R console (Not used by Rterm, which shows the output in the terminal 
 unless wait Is false).

.PP

\fBminimized\fB \fR\- 
 logical (Not NA), indicates whether a command window should be displayed initially 
 as a minimized window.

.SH VALUE
.PP
If intern = TRUE, a character vector giving the output of the command, one line per 
 character string. (Output lines of more than 8095 bytes will be split.) If the command 
 could not be run an R error is generated. Under the Rgui console intern = TRUE also 
 captures stderr unless ignore.stderr = TRUE. If command runs but gives a non-zero exit 
 status this will be reported with a warning and in the attribute "status" of the result: 
 an attribute "errmsg" may also be available.

 If intern = False, the Return value Is an Error code (0 For success), given the invisible 
 attribute (so needs To be printed explicitly). If the command could Not be run For any 
 reason, the value Is 127 And a warning Is issued (As from R 3.5.0). Otherwise If 
 wait = True the value Is the Exit status returned by the command, And If wait = False it 
 Is 0 (the conventional success value).

 If the command times out, a warning Is reported And the Exit status Is 124. Some Windows 
 commands Return out-Of-range status values (e.g., -1) And so only the bottom 16 bits Of 
 the value are used.

 If intern = False, wait = True, show.output.On.console = True the 'stdout’ and ‘stderr’ 
 (unless ignore.stdout = TRUE or ignore.stderr = TRUE) output from a command that is a 
 ‘console application’ should appear in the R console (Rgui) or the window running R 
 (Rterm).

 Not all Windows executables properly respect redirection of output, Or may only do so 
 from a console application such as Rterm And Not from Rgui For example, 'fc.exe’ was 
 among these in the past, but we have had more success recently.

.SH DETAILS
.PP
This interface has become rather complicated over the years: see system2 for a more 
 portable and flexible interface which is recommended for new code.

 command Is parsed as a command plus arguments separated by spaces. So if the path to 
 the command (Or a single argument such as a file path) contains spaces, it must be 
 quoted e.g. by shQuote. Only double quotes are allowed on Windows: see the examples. 
 (Note: a Windows path name cannot contain a Double quote, so we Do Not need To worry 
 about escaping embedded quotes.)

 command must be an executable (extensions '.exe’, ‘.com’) or a batch file (extensions 
 ‘.cmd’ and ‘.bat’): these extensions are tried in turn if none is supplied. This 
 means that redirection, pipes, DOS internal commands, ... cannot be used: see shell 
 if you want to pass a shell command-line.

 The search path For command may be system-dependent: it will include the R 'bin’ 
 directory, the working directory and the Windows system directories before PATH.

 When timeout Is non-zero, the command Is terminated after the given number of seconds. 
 The termination works for typical commands, but Is Not guaranteed it Is possible to 
 write a program that would keep running after the time Is out. Timeouts can only be 
 set with wait = TRUE.

 The ordering Of arguments after the first two has changed from time To time: it Is 
 recommended to name all arguments after the first.

 There are many pitfalls In Using system To ascertain If a command can be run — 
 Sys.which Is more suitable.
