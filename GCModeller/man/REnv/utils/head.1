[\fB<Environment>\fR]);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Return the First or Last Part of an Object
 
 Returns the first or last parts of a vector, matrix, table, data frame or function. 
 Since head() and tail() are generic functions, they may also have been extended 
 to other classes.

 a transformed format(x).

.SH DETAILS
.PP
For matrices, 2-dim tables and data frames, head() (tail()) returns the first (last) 
 n rows when n >= 0 or all but the last (first) n rows when n < 0. head.matrix() 
 and tail.matrix() are exported. For functions, the lines of the deparsed function 
 are returned as character strings.

 If a matrix has no row names, Then tail() will add row names Of the form "[n,]" 
 To the result, so that it looks similar To the last lines Of x When printed. 
 Setting addrownums = False suppresses this behaviour.
