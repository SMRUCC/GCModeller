 Given a set of logical vectors, are all of the values true?
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBtest\fB \fR\- zero or more logical vectors. Other objects of zero

 class.

The value is a logical vector of length one.

 Let x denote the concatenation of all the logical vectors in ... 
 (after coercion), after removing NAs if requested by na.rm = TRUE.

 The value returned Is True If all Of the values In x are True 
 (including If there are no values), And False If at least one Of 
 the values In x Is False. Otherwise the value Is NA (which can
